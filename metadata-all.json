The chief engineer does not see the power of the masses and lacks confidence in completing tasks. Employment thinking also exists among a small number of workers. In order to manufacture the abutments and rivets needed to repair the iron bridge, the steel furnace must first be repaired. For this reason, worker Liang Risheng created a method of replacing dolomite with refractory bricks, and the test was successful.

Through Lao Wei's relationship, he instills discouragement in Lao Li, and tries his best to win the favor of Lao Li's daughter Xiulan. Lao Li and Lao Wei were deceived by Qi Ziming's rhetoric, so they betrothed Xiulan to him. Later, with the help of technicians, Meng Kuiyuan reformed the tool and created the highest production record. Driven by Xiaomeng and influenced by other workers, Lao Li also overcame his conservative thinking. Through the reform of tools, he repeatedly shortened the calibration time of the turning screw, and kept setting new records.

Li Laochuan is an old mind. He insisted on marrying his daughter to Zhao Dakui in Xizaozhuang. Xiulan disagreed, and went to the village women's director to discuss it. The women's director used her own experience to make Xiulanniang understand the harm of arranged marriages, and she no longer opposed her daughter's free love. When Xiulan and Guichun went to the village government to go through the registration procedures, they met Xiulan's father and went to the district to get Xiulan and Dakui a marriage certificate. It turned out that it was a letter of introduction written by the confused village chief to Li Laochuan. The women's director criticized the village head's mistake, so the village head immediately led Xiulan and Guichun to the district government to register. In the district, Li Laochuan and Da Kui's father Zhao Laoman were a little puzzled when they saw that the village chief suddenly changed his mind. After the district chief explained, Li Laochuan agreed to cancel Xiulan and Zhao Dakui's engagement, but he still opposed Xiulan and Guichun's marriage, and angrily announced that he and Xiulan would break away from their father-daughter relationship. After Xiulan and Guichun got married, they lived a very good life. After some days, Li Laochuan finally realized what was wrong, and resumed his father-daughter relationship with Xiulan.",

A memorial service is being held in front of the tomb of Wuxun Temple outside Liulin Town, Tangyi County, Shandong Province. A female teacher tells the story of Wuxun to the children:{LINE_CUT} Wu Xun was born in a poor peasant family. He lost his father at the age of five, and he begged for food with his mother for two years. One day, seven-year-old Wu Xun ran into a private house with two hundred copper coins he had accumulated so hard, and begged the teacher to accept him to study, but was kicked out by the rich family's children. When he returned home, his mother had died of illness. His aunt raised him for seven years. After that, he went out to work and wandered around. At the age of seventeen, Wu Xun advocated for Dadi in Xuedian Village, Guantao County, to work as a long-term worker in Juren's family. He was bullied and exploited by Zhang Juren and his henchmen Zhao Xiong and others. At Zhang Ju's family, he met Zhou Da, a coachman who had participated in the Taiping Army, and was taken care of by Zhou Da. From Zhou Dakou, he learned of the unfortunate experience of Zhang Ju's maidservant Xiaotao being tricked into writing a contract of sale by Zhang, and expressed deep sympathy for Xiaotao, and understood the pain of the poor who are illiterate. Three years later, Wu Xun's aunt fell ill, and Wu Xun's nephew, Xiao Maolin, came to Wu Xun. Wu Xun asked Zhang Juren for wages, but Zhang Juren falsified the accounts, saying that the wages had been paid. Wu Xun argued and was beaten again. The coachman Zhou Da was aggrieved, beat the dog leg, and rescued Wu Xun to a ruined temple. Zhang Juren colluded with the government and sent Zhou Da to death row. The maid Xiaotao was forced by the fourth grandmother to sell to Butcher Cao, so she fled to the ruined temple to find Wu Xun. When she saw the clown-like Wu Xun who had just escaped from depression, with crooked braids, knocking on a copper ladle, laughing and singing the lyrics of Xiuyixue, she didn't want to destroy Wuxun's Xiuyixue plan, and didn't tell him about it. At this time, the dog leg Zhao Xiong came to the ruined temple, snatched Xiao Tao, and beat Wu Xun.

At the beginning, the workers' fighting spirit was very high, but due to the underestimation of the difficulties, the struggle suffered some losses. At the critical juncture, Zhang Shifang, secretary of the underground party branch of the spinning mill, made the best use of the situation, avoided a larger-scale bloody sacrifice and preserved his strength. In order to cover the needs of underground party organizations and workers' struggle, Zhang Shifang tactfully broke into the yellow trade union. In order to win votes in the election, Zhou Gaoming, a stickler of the Kuomintang, confiscated the ID cards of all the workers in the factory, which led to the strike of the workers in the whole factory. The bloody repression by the enemy and the solidarity of workers and students throughout the city made the strike a victory. Subsequently, the People's Liberation Army marched on Shanghai, and the Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to remove supplies and destroy factory machinery.

The relationship between the two was very good. After the liberation of Shanghai, they were transferred to work in Shanghai. Li went to work in the reference room of a textile company, and Zhang went to a spinning mill to do women's work. Zhang grew up in a harsh and simple environment in the countryside, and was not used to the urban lifestyle at first. Li originally grew up in Shanghai. After returning to the city, he gradually lost the hard work and simplicity he had in the liberated areas. There was an invisible gap between the couple. Once, Zhang saw a beggar girl Xiaojuan being bullied by the dance floor owner at the entrance of the dance hall, so he went up to fight against the injustice and took Xiao Juan back. Li Ke has a lot of opinions on this. Then, Zhang's hometown was flooded, and Zhang sent Li Ke's manuscript fee back to his hometown for disaster relief without any discussion. Li Ke became more and more dissatisfied. Zhang blamed Li for forgetting the farmers after entering the city, and greedy for enjoyment. Li accused Zhang of being narrow-minded and selfish. The two separated because of this. Later, through the criticism and help of their old leader Qin Feng and contact with the workers, Zhang gained a new understanding of his thinking, and Li also wrote to his wife to criticize. At this time, something was lost in the spinning mill, and the owner insisted that it was Xiaojuan who stole it. After being wronged, Xiaojuan left a note and ran away. In the middle of the night, Zhang and Li rushed to Xiaojuan's house to comfort her, and the couple reconciled.",

However, the cooperative only supplies daily necessities to members, but does not solve the problem of selling grapes, which affects the enthusiasm of members for production. Aunt Zhou wanted to sell the grapes quickly in order to buy a water tanker for the village and make a dowry for her daughter Zhou Hong'e. Shuangxi, the son of the director of the cooperative, Ding Laogui, falls in love with Hong'e. Ding Laogui can't accept the new thing of free love, so he doesn't buy the grapes from Aunt Zhou. Some conflicts and misunderstandings arise between the two families. In a fit of rage, Aunt Zhou wanted to sell the grapes to the profiteer Diao Jin, but was dissuaded by Gong Yuquan, a worker supporting the agriculture. The village party branch reported the situation to the county party committee.

The workers fought under the leadership of the underground party. When Ma Badai celebrated his 70th birthday, the workers Hu Er, Ding Zhanyuan and others made a big banquet, forcing them to put their hair on their hair and withhold their wages. Not only did Baotou not agree to increase wages, but he forced the workers to carry the evacuated materials for the Kuomintang reactionaries. The workers at Gate No. 6 united with porters throughout the city to stage a general strike, and the struggle was victorious. Subsequently, Ma Jinlong sent spies and thugs to arrest Hu Er and put him in prison. After liberation, Hu Er got his freedom and went home to meet Ding Zhanyuan and others. Ma Jinlong tried to buy Hu Er and was reprimanded. Hu Er was elected as the head of the porter service station, and Ding Zhanyuan became the chairman of the labor union. The old tyrant Ma Badai tried his best to fight the workers' service station, but failed. In the end, the blood-debt Ma family father and son were punished by law.",

The party organization of the company called on everyone to invent and create, to replace gasoline with other fuels, and asked the knowledgeable and experienced engineer Zhang to design a white coal car. Zhang lacked confidence at the beginning, thinking that burning white coal was more troublesome than using gasoline. Even if the white coal car was successfully designed, it would not be easy to be valued and promoted by the leaders and the masses. Wang Zhishu and Lao Zhao, the company's army representative, encouraged Engineer Zhang, and Wang even went to work as an assistant to Zhang himself. After hard work, Zhang quickly designed the white coal car. But the first test run failed. Zhang was very disappointed and decided to stop the test. His lover and Minister He encouraged him enthusiastically, and the mechanic Lao Guo helped him find out the fault of the white coal stove. Zhang was deeply moved and mustered up his courage again. After several revisions, the white coal car was finally manufactured, which not only solved the fuel supply problem, but also reversed the company's losses.",

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "Yao's husband died when she was twenty-five years old. She has a son and a daughter. The daughter is Yingying, and the son is Jimeng. After Meng married his wife, the couple had a very good relationship, but the mother-in-law was very unhappy about it. One day, the daughter-in-law brought food to the mother-in-law. The mother-in-law deliberately made it difficult for the daughter-in-law, asking the daughter-in-law to make eighty-six kinds of meals for her to choose from. If the daughter-in-law can't do it, Yao will beat her with a whip. Yingying went into the house to persuade her, and agreed to make another bowl of noodles for her mother. Yingying walked out of the room with the noodles made by her sister-in-law, walked around, and brought them back again, saying that she made them herself, and Yao praised them as she ate them. After eating noodles, Yao felt that his daughter-in-law's sweeping of the yard was not clean and the soles of her shoes were not neat. Yingying was afraid that her mother would blame her sister-in-law again, so she said that she did both of these things. The mother immediately turned her anger into joy and praised her daughter for her ability. Seeing that her mother was so biased, Yingying felt very uncomfortable and told the truth on the spot, which embarrassed her. Yao became furious and insulted his daughter-in-law, taught his sister-in-law badly, and wanted to beat her to death. Yingying is eager to make up his mind. On the one hand, he persuaded his mother to hand over his sister-in-law to his brother for discipline, and on the other hand, he asked his brother to pretend to beat his sister-in-law. Following Yingying's plan, Jimeng deliberately angrily dragged his wife into the room, beat the chair cushions with a stick, and told his wife to pretend to be dead to scare his mother. Yao believed it to be true, and was afraid of being killed and sued, so he trembled in fright. Seeing this, Yingling pretends to save his sister-in-law, who also pretends to be resurrected from the dead. Later, in order to help her mother get through the feudal ideology, Yingying pretended to commit suicide by crying and throwing herself into the river, fearing that she would meet a mother-in-law like her in the future. The sister-in-law was so angry that she asked her to eat and dress like her, so Yao had no choice but to agree. From then on, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were in harmony, and Mrs. Yao no longer picked on his daughter-in-law.",

Therefore, through Matchmaker Liu, Xiaolan found another husband's family, and agreed on the gift. Xiaolan disagreed with the marriage, and quarreled with her father.

At this time, the gift giver from the male family's Wei family had already arrived, and Lao Zhao found out that Xiaolan and Yonggang had gone to the district government to register their marriage. He was about to go to the village chairman to sue Yonggang for abducting his daughter, when the village chairman and women's director happened to come to his house. The village chairman told Mr. Zhao that he should be assigned to another group, but Mr. Zhao disagreed, saying that the organization of the group was voluntary and could not be arranged and replaced, which was stipulated by the government. The village chairman asked him: You know that you are willing to be voluntary, and you are looking for a partner, but why did you arrange Xiaolan's marriage? Didn't the government also stipulate a new marriage law? Old Zhao was speechless. At this time, because Xiulan couldn't bear the beating and scolding from her husband and mother-in-law, she came home from divorce. The Wei family also sent someone to send a letter saying that the man had already chosen his partner. After being educated on this series of facts, Lao Zhao's mind became clear.

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "Before liberation, Ma Waibao, the eldest son of Ma Waibao, a Hui farmer in Hongshigou Village, somewhere in the northwest, was killed by the bully Ma Xiren in collusion with Ma Bufang's army. In order to take revenge, Ma Waibao trained his youngest son Maybra to be a famous hunter. When the People's Liberation Army marched into Mayibra in the northwest, Ma Xiren colluded with the enemy and dragged him into the army. Ma Xiren spread rumors that the People's Liberation Army killed Muslims and exterminated religions in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Hui people and the People's Liberation Army. Comrade Li, the working team leader of the People's Liberation Army, promoted the party's ethnic policy and quickly gained the trust and cooperation of the people. Ma Xiren was afraid that Ma Yibula would come back for revenge, so he ordered the enemy leader Ma Erhu to guard Ma Yibula strictly to prevent him from escaping. Maybra's hunting friend Makarik secretly went back to the village to visit, only to know that the People's Liberation Army is a poor team, and told Maybra about the situation. Soon, Ma Xiren was about to attack the village. Ma Waibao learned the news from the enemy post and reported the news to Comrade Li, the leader of the People's Liberation Army working group. When the enemy attacked the village at night, he was ambushed by the People's Liberation Army. Maybra took the opportunity to kill an enemy. Seeing his son fleeing, Ma Waibao intercepted his son on a small road, and prepared to kill his relatives righteously. Fortunately, Comrade Li arrived in time, proving that Ma Yibula really had the heart of submission and had made meritorious service to atone for his crimes. Only then did father and son recognize each other. In the end, Maybra cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to capture Ma Xiren alive.",

With the support and help of Party branch secretary Liu Ziqiang, director Tang Likai, and Soviet expert Ulanov, this method was successful. Guo Dapeng's advanced experience attracted the attention of the Central Ministry of Railways. At the National Machinery Conference, Deputy Minister Lu of the Ministry of Railways encouraged Guo Dapeng not only to pull more, but also to run fast. Winter brought great difficulties to Chaozhou, and the train could not climb the slope of Quntuoling. Guo Dapeng requested that the {QUOTE}999{QUOTE} be transferred to the line of Quntuoling. But Meng Fanju disagreed, worrying that if this nationally famous locomotive had an accident, the impact would be too great. Deputy Minister Lu came to inspect the work, criticized Meng Fanju's conservative thinking, and called on the whole branch to carry out the Dora Run movement.

Meng Changyou, the monitor of the spare parts team, used to be a tong worker and had personally experienced the hardships of tong work. After liberation, after two years of assiduous research, he put forward suggestions for improving the rolling equipment. Engineer Ding, who mechanically copied books, thought it was risky; the bureaucratic factory director also opposed it. Secretary Liu of the factory party committee supported Meng Changyou's suggestion. The first trial failed due to an imperfect design. Later, with the assistance of Engineer Ding and young workers, Meng Changyou overcame various difficulties and invented the anti-enclosure, which mechanized and automated the steel rolling process, improved working conditions, and increased productivity.",

He was once trusted by engineer Zhou Changmin and director Dong. . Bishop He, the hidden Italian spy, instigated the spy Father Shi to steal the key to the safe where the drawings were stored, and the locksmith reported the situation to the public security department. Bai Bingzhong stole the blueprints and tried to lure Engineer Zhou to Hong Kong by all means of instigation and threats. Engineer Zhou reported the situation to Director Dong. It turned out that the blueprints stolen by the spies were fake, and had really been moved to another place for preservation as ordered by the public security personnel. Seeing that his goal had not been achieved and that Bai Bingzhong had been exposed, Bishop He ordered Bai Bingzhong to assassinate Engineer Zhou, and at the same time sent another person to assassinate Bai Bingzhong in order to silence him.

The Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries tried in vain to prevent the People's Liberation Army from crossing the river by virtue of the natural danger of the Yangtze River.

After crossing the river, they got in touch with Liu Sijie, the captain of the Baimashan guerrilla team. After the enemy found out, they immediately sent troops to search. Company Commander Li and others disguised themselves as enemy troops, cleverly passed through the enemy's blockade, killed Hou Dengke, the captain of the pseudo-security team, and arrived at the guerrilla base. With the cooperation of the local guerrillas, they penetrated into the enemy's heart, got the map of the enemy's river defense fortifications, and found out the deployment of the enemy's howitzer positions. Unexpectedly, he was discovered by the chief of enemy intelligence, and a large number of troops were dispatched in an attempt to eliminate this team of scouts. Scout Zhou Changxi died a heroic sacrifice to cover his comrades. The enemy attacked the guerrilla base, and Company Commander Li and the others lost contact with Jiangbei, so they sent Wu Laogui and Xiao Ma to break out and swim across the river in the dark to send intelligence. Wu Laogui sacrificed to protect the pony. Xiao Ma sent the information to the chief of staff of our army in time. At this time, Li Lianchang, who stayed in the south of the Yangtze River, also led his troops to break out.

She was a widow for more than ten years under the shackles of feudal ethics. According to the {QUOTE}family law{QUOTE} of the Yang family, widows were not allowed to remarry. There is an honest and loyal single farmer in this village, Zeng Liangchen, who sympathizes with the orphan and widowed mother, and falls in love with Mrs. Li Fu, but the two can only keep in touch with each other in secret. After liberation, Li Fu's wife and Zeng Liangchen became even closer. Mrs. Lifu's daughter, Yang Chunmei, also fell in love with Zhu Xiaochang, a young man from the village. Patriarch Yang Yongcheng thinks that Mrs. Lifu's contact with Zeng Liangchen is a disgrace to Yang's family. In order to prevent the family's ugliness from being publicized, he listens to Yang Yongde's bad idea and wants to marry Yang Chunmei to Zeng Liangchen by embedding flowers. For this reason, Mrs. Li Fu was forced to hang herself and attempted suicide. Yang Chunmei resolutely refused to marry Zeng Liangchen. Under the leadership of the party organization and the government, and with the support of the village chief Wang and the young people in the village, she waged a resolute struggle against feudal ideology. Yang Yongcheng convened a family meeting, intending to use family rules and family laws to rectify Li Fu's mother-in-law and daughter.

Afraid that the conspiracy would be exposed, Xie wanted to poison Menghe's steward Lang Jie to death with poison and wine, but Lang Jie saw through. The Kuomintang reactionaries airdropped spies again, intimidating Luo Bu to increase and detain the working group. Chen Shaohua sent Xiao Li and Da Jie to deliver a letter to the military division. The People's Government marched into Menghe at the request of representatives of various ethnic groups. Xie panicked and assassinated Lang Jie in order to silence him. Before Lang Jie died, he revealed Xie's conspiracy to chieftain Luo Bu Danzeng.

At this time, the wheat received by the agricultural cooperative could not be distributed because the labor account had not been settled, and the members of the cooperative discussed a lot. It turned out that Mi Sanduo, an accountant in the cooperative, colluded with Wang Dacheng, a rich farmer, to sabotage the development of the cooperative, use the funds in the cooperative for speculation, and deliberately confuse the accounts. Seeing this situation, Tian Jinsheng encouraged and helped the second girl in high school to study accounting, and fought against the rich peasants. But Mi Yulan is not interested in any of this. Soon, the school announced that Tian Jinsheng was admitted to high school, but Mi Yulan was not. Tian Jinsheng persuaded Mi Yulan to stay in the village and do accounting work, but Mi despised the work of the agricultural cooperative. In pursuit of vanity and material comfort, her father Mi Sanduo married her to a businessman in the city. At this time, the superior approved the Paomabao Village Agricultural Cooperative to run a trial tractor station, but there was a shortage of financial and accounting personnel. For the benefit of the cooperative, Tian Jinsheng decided not to go to high school, but to stay and build his hometown, regardless of his mother's objection. Mi Sanduo and Wang Dacheng knew that their old background would be exposed, so they set fire to food in an attempt to steal the ledger and destroy the criminal evidence, and were finally arrested and brought to justice. The accounts of the cooperative were clarified, and the members were all distributed with food. Tian Jinsheng and Gao Erniu established a relationship in the joint labor.",

This trick was seen through by the cunning Matsui, and the enemy continued to stay in Lizhuang. Thanks to Yang Laozong's suggestion, Matsui found a tunnel. In order to save the villagers, Li Xiangyang led people into the city and blew up the enemy's ammunition train. Unexpectedly, not long after Matsui led the army to leave Lizhuang, he immediately led the team back, forcing the masses to go out of the tunnel, and killing Lao Qin and Xiao Baozi, in a vain attempt to obtain the food that was firmly in Lizhuang.

Daizong and the mother of the country investigated the reason for the quarrel between the young couple, and they knew that the princess was at fault, so they blamed her for not paying respects to the father-in-law's birthday. The princess acted like a spoiled child, so Daizong wanted to kill the son-in-law to vent her anger. When the princess heard this, she was so frightened that she lost her mind, so Daizong smiled and told the princess: It was a lie to kill the son-in-law. Guo Ziyi heard that Guo Ai had beaten the princess, and immediately tied Guo Ai to the hall to plead guilty. Daizong thought that Guo Ziyi was old and accomplished, and he could not quarrel with his children about private matters, which hurt the harmony of the monarch and his ministers. He pardoned Guo Ai for beating the princess and vilifying the king, and promoted Guo Ai to three ranks to show his respect. Then, Daizong returned to the harem with his son-in-law, and told the princess face-to-face not to rely on power to bully others, and told her to go to the birthday party immediately to make amends. good.

Yang Xiaolong's father, Yang Caifa, believed that he had a set of skills in growing oranges, and instead of participating in mutual aid groups, he made his own fortune. Yang Xiaolong has a lot of opinions on his father. The mutual aid group was inexperienced at the beginning, and the evaluation points for work were unreasonable, and some team members clamored to quit the group. Later, Li Yinhua and Wang Huber implemented the method of getting paid according to work, which improved everyone's enthusiasm for work. Soon, the orange trees were severely plagued by insects, and Yang Caifa's secret recipe for controlling insects for many years also lost its effect. At this time, the government allocated insecticides and sprayers, and Li Yinhua led the mutual aid team to eliminate the pests in time, and also helped Yang Caifa and other single-handed households control the pests. Yang Caifa was deeply educated, and he and some other self-employed households asked to join the mutual aid group. Li Yinhua and Yang Xiaolong also love each other more intimately.",

    "plot" : "《群英会》是小说《三国演义》中的一段。\n曹操率八十三万人马，要消灭夏口的刘备和东吴的孙权。刘备与孙权联合应战，遂派孔明来到东吴。东吴都督周瑜，奉命御敌于三江口。周瑜少年英俊，忌孔明比自己才高，而自信有破曹的把握。因此，想杀孔明以绝东吴后患。\n曹营谋士蒋干，以为和周瑜有同窗友谊，自愿过江劝说周瑜降曹。周瑜知道蒋干来意，夜间和蒋干同榻而卧，故意让他发现一封曹营水军头领蔡瑁、张允给周瑜的信，信上说将杀曹操而后来降。蒋干盗了这封假信，逃回曹营。曹操见信，斩了蔡瑁、张允，但随即觉悟到中了周瑜的诡计，便派蔡瑁的兄弟蔡中、蔡和去江东诈降。\n周瑜以为自己的妙计无人知晓，不料孔明一见面就庆贺他“借刀杀人“成功，为此，周瑜更忌孔明。他借口军中缺箭，让孔明在一月内造十万枝箭。孔明却答应在三天之内造成，否则愿受军法处置。次日，孔明向鲁肃借快船二十只，外蒙帐幔茅草，在浓雾之中驶近曹营，擂鼓呐喊。曹操以为周瑜来偷营，命部下乱箭齐发，箭都射在草船上。孔明在霎时得到了十万枝利箭。\n蔡中、蔡和来降，周瑜发觉其中有诈，就将计就计，把两人留下。随后和老将黄盖定下诈降曹营的苦肉计。在庆贺孔明借箭回营的宴席间，黄盖故意力主降曹，周瑜假装大怒，责打黄盖。\n黄盖被打后，请大夫阚泽去曹营下诈降书，曹操发觉信中有诈，欲杀阚泽。但阚泽机智镇定，从容对答。正在这时，蔡中、蔡和将周瑜打黄盖的消息密报曹操，曹操这才接受黄盖投降。但他仍不放心，又派蒋干再次过江，打听实信。\n周瑜和孔明决定火攻曹营，遂与庞统定下连环计，让庞统在蒋干面前说周瑜不能容人。蒋干劝庞统归曹，于是两人连夜潜回曹营。庞统劝曹操将满江战船连锁起来，以便不惯乘船的北军也能水战。曹操采纳了此项建议。\n周瑜闻曹操中连环计，十分得意。不料一阵西北风提醒他：吴军位于东南，曹军位于西北，若用火攻，必烧自己而不能破敌，遂忧虑成疾。孔明写了一张“病源“给周瑜：“欲破曹兵，须用火攻；万事俱备，只欠东风“。周瑜一看，病体即愈。孔明自言能借东风。就在孔明借风时，周瑜派将士埋伏山后，等东风一起，就杀孔明。可是孔明早料到周瑜有此一招，东风起时，他就悄悄逃到江边，乘赵子龙备好的船只回转夏口去了。",

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "{QUOTE}The Meeting of Heroes{QUOTE} is a passage in the novel {QUOTE}The Romance of the Three Kingdoms{QUOTE}.{LINE_CUT}Cao Cao led 830,000 troops to eliminate Liu Bei in Xiakou and Sun Quan in Dongwu. Liu Bei and Sun Quan joined forces to fight, so they sent Kong Ming to Soochow. Zhou Yu, governor of Eastern Wu, was ordered to defend against the enemy at Sanjiangkou. Zhou Yu is a handsome young man, he is afraid that Kong Ming is more talented than himself, and he is confident that he can defeat Cao. Therefore, I want to kill Kong Ming to avoid future troubles of Soochow.{LINE_CUT}Jiang Gan, Cao Ying's adviser, thought he had a classmate friendship with Zhou Yu, so he voluntarily crossed the river to persuade Zhou Yu to surrender Cao. Knowing Jiang Gan's intention, Zhou Yu slept with Jiang Gan at night, deliberately letting him find a letter from Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, the leaders of Cao Ying's water army, to Zhou Yu, saying that he would kill Cao Cao and then surrender. Jiang Gan stole the false letter and fled back to Cao Ying. When Cao Cao saw the letter, he beheaded Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, but then realized that he had fallen for Zhou Yu's trick, so he sent Cai Mao's brothers Cai Zhong and Cai He to Jiangdong to feign surrender.{LINE_CUT}Zhou Yu thought that no one would know about his clever plan, but Kong Ming congratulated him on his success in {QUOTE}borrowing a knife to kill someone{QUOTE} as soon as they met. Zhou Yu was even more jealous of Kong Ming for this reason. He asked Kong Ming to make 100,000 arrows in one month on the pretext of lack of arrows in the army. Kong Ming promised to finish it within three days, otherwise he would be punished by military law. The next day, Kong Ming borrowed 20 fast boats from Lu Su, covered with thatched tents, and approached Cao Ying in the dense fog, beating drums and shouting. Cao Cao thought that Zhou Yu had come to steal the camp, so he ordered his subordinates to fire arrows at random, and all the arrows hit the grass boat. Kong Ming got one hundred thousand sharp arrows in an instant.{LINE_CUT}When Cai Zhong and Cai He came to surrender, Zhou Yu found out that there was a fraud, so he used his plan and left them behind. Then he and veteran Huang Gai made a bitter plan to feign surrender to Cao Ying. During the banquet to celebrate Kongming's return to camp with an arrow, Huang Gai tried his best to surrender Cao, but Zhou Yu pretended to be furious and beat Huang Gai.{LINE_CUT}After Huang Gai was beaten, he asked doctor Kan Ze to send a letter of surrender to Cao Ying. Cao Cao found out that there was a fraud in the letter and wanted to kill Kan Ze. But Kan Ze was witty and calm, and answered calmly. At this time, Cai Zhong and Cai He secretly reported the news that Zhou Yu had beaten Huang Gai to Cao Cao, and Cao Cao accepted Huang Gai's surrender. But he was still worried, and sent Jiang Gan to cross the river again to inquire about the truth.{LINE_CUT}Zhou Yu and Kong Ming decided to attack Cao Ying with fire, so they made a series of plans with Pang Tong, asking Pang Tong to say in front of Jiang Gan that Zhou Yu could not tolerate others. Jiang Gan persuaded Pang Tong to return to Cao, so the two sneaked back to Cao Ying overnight. Pang Tong persuaded Cao Cao to link up the warships all over the river, so that the Northern Army, who was not used to taking boats, could also fight in water. Cao Cao adopted this suggestion.{LINE_CUT}Zhou Yu was very proud when he heard that Cao Cao had played a series of tricks. Unexpectedly, a gust of northwest wind reminded him: Wu's army is located in the southeast, and Cao's army is located in the northwest. If they attack with fire, they will burn themselves instead of destroying the enemy, so they became sick from worry. Kong Ming wrote a piece of {QUOTE}The Source of Disease{QUOTE} to Zhou Yu: {QUOTE}If you want to break Cao's soldiers, you must attack with fire; everything is ready, and you only owe the east wind.{QUOTE} Zhou Yu saw that the sick body was cured. Kong Ming said that he could borrow the east wind. Just when Kong Ming was borrowing the wind, Zhou Yu sent soldiers to ambush behind the mountain, and when the east wind came, he would kill Kong Ming. But Kong Ming had expected Zhou Yu's move. When the east wind picked up, he quietly fled to the riverside, and returned to Xiakou in the boat prepared by Zhao Zilong.",

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "In the spring of 1944, a company of a certain unit of the New Fourth Army was training in Liubao Village in northern Jiangsu. Li Jin, the deputy of the fourth class, fell in love with the second sister of the Tian family when he was recuperating at the old man's house. The instructor talked to Li Jin to dissuade him, because falling in love was not allowed by the discipline of the army in the cruel struggle environment at that time. Although Li Jin expressed to the instructor that he would give up this feeling, deep down in his heart he still had nostalgia for the second sister. After the team left Liubao Village, Liu Huzi, the squadron leader of the traitor puppet army, wanted to marry the second sister by force, so he sent the landlord Wang shopkeeper to bring the dog's legs into the village to snatch the second sister away. The army went to rescue after hearing the news, Li Jin killed the traitor landlord and rescued the second sister. After the second sister was saved, she loved Li Jin even more, and Li Jin's heart was alive again. Soon, the army was about to go on an expedition, and Li Jin fell into a painful contradiction. With the help of the instructor, he finally gave up his personal feelings and marched south with the army. Five years later, Li Jin had been promoted to company commander. He learned that Er Meizi had been fighting guerrillas after the army left, joined the party, became a cadre, and had been waiting for him. When Li Jin led the team through Liubao Village, he finally reunited with the second sister who led the grain ship.",

Laichun reluctantly abandoned his father, reported the information to the district chief Wang of the guerrillas, and bravely undertook the task of returning to the village to cooperate with the army's operations. When he returned to the village, he was unfortunately arrested by the enemy. Although he was tortured, he did not give in. Just when the enemy was about to bury the whole village alive, the guerrillas arrived in time, wiped out the Home Returning Mission, and liberated Laichun's hometown again.",

Later, the construction site was hit by a severe storm, which affected the progress of the project. In this case, the section chief with conservative ideas could not see the strength of the masses and advocated asking for support from the superior. Foreman Wen Guomao and Secretary Jin relied on the masses to carry out technological innovation. Encouraged by the workers, Shang Yue put forward an unrealistic innovative plan, but the experiment failed again. At this time, Shang Yue was frustrated by the objection of section chief Bai Fu and love problems, and the ideological struggle was fierce.

This gave Wu Laorui, an old member who was dissatisfied with the provident fund left in the club, an excuse, and took the opportunity to clamor to quit the club. The Social Management Committee discussed Liu Shousheng's corruption. Song Chunliang, the female president of the cooperative, hated her husband's criminal behavior very much, but Shou Shengniang blindly protected her son and persuaded his daughter-in-law Song Chunliang to come to the cooperative to intercede. Although Song Chunliang loved her husband very much, for the benefit of all members, she selflessly sent her husband who embezzled public funds to the court, which eased the conflicts in the society. Later, Shousheng performed well in the labor reform and was released early by the court. At that time, water conservancy was being developed in the cooperative. One day, Sun Shunian, secretary of the party branch of the cooperative, asked Shousheng to go to the city to obtain a water conservancy loan, which aroused suspicion and dissatisfaction among some people. Instigated by Zhao Quanyou, Wu Laorui clamored to quit the company again. As a result, Shousheng got back the loan in full. Later, Zhao Quanyou, a profiteer who disturbed the national grain market, was punished by the county people's court according to law, and Wu Laorui and others were also educated; for the development of the cooperative, Song Chunliang, who had suffered many grievances and difficulties, gained everyone's greater trust.",

During the agricultural cooperative period, he was afraid of losing money, so he was reluctant to join the cooperative. His younger brother sent a letter from the army asking Mandun to join the club, otherwise the family would be separated, so Mandun had no choice but to lead the animals into the club and work as a breeder in the club. Because of his selfishness, he always saves good fodder for his own animals. He was sent to drive a carriage, but he dragged his feet to do business. He was asked to go to the city to pull manure, and he used the money from the cooperative to buy manure to buy piglets. He was assigned to dig a well, but he secretly sold red dates.

They used a dilapidated temple as a factory for production and set up the factory under extremely difficult conditions. Later, the hidden counter-revolutionaries in the factory colluded with the class dissidents who became the secretary of the party branch to sabotage and cause trouble, resulting in a decline in product quality. The factory manager decided to stop the factory. With the support of Director Wang of the Provincial Bureau of Industry, Su Xinjun, a member of the Communist Party and a technician, led the workers to build the reverberatory furnace. If there were no refractory bricks, they would pick waste bricks; if there was no brick grinder, they would grind them by hand. After the furnace was repaired, the workers did not know how to operate it, and the trial failed. In addition, the director and engineer of another factory poured cold water on it, and many workers were very discouraged. At this time, the director of the industry bureau came to the scene to encourage. Su Xinjun summed up the lessons from the failure, pooled the wisdom of the masses, rebuilt the reverberatory furnace, and finally smelted refined copper. Soon, the counter-revolutionaries were arrested, the branch secretary and factory director were dismissed, and Su became the factory director. Subsequently, Dalian Shipyard ordered three and a half tons of phosphor bronze-nickel alloy from the factory. This is a new product that is difficult to make, and because the order is small, the workshop director and the financial section chief think it is a loss-making deal and refuse to accept the order. Party branch secretary Zhang Siwei and factory director Su Xinjun carried forward the spirit of socialist industrial cooperation and accepted the order. In order to help other factories solve difficulties, they sent supply and marketing personnel to run around and deliver goods to the door, thus solving the problem of production profit. In the eleven years since the factory was established, they have produced 274 high-quality alloy products.",

Chief engineer Tang Zhongshi stressed that there were difficulties. In order to complete this task, foreman Zhao Deliang proposed to modify the refractory bricks. Chief Engineer Tang, who was superstitious about books, opposed Zhao's suggestion; Liu Houlu, the section chief who admired Chief Engineer Tang, was afraid of losing the honor of the entire section if the furnace was damaged, and opposed the use of modified refractory bricks to build the furnace. The headquarters adopted Zhao's suggestion. However, when building the gas furnace, because the young apprentice He Jinbiao was not careful in his work, the furnace did not meet the specifications and caused rework. After inspection, Hua, Zhao and others confirmed that the accident occurred because of a technical problem in building the furnace, and decided to continue building the furnace, and finally built the furnace. Then, a fire broke out in the electric welding processing plant, burning out four electric welding machines, which brought great difficulties to the construction of the chemical fertilizer plant. At this time, Chief Engineer Tang advocated the purchase of a new electric welding machine. Zhao Ze proposed to trial-manufacture a water-resistance electric welding machine, and the trial-manufacture was successful, ensuring that the fertilizer plant was completed and put into production ahead of schedule. After several lessons from the facts, finally, Chief Engineer Tang realized that he was superstitious about books and asked to go to the rural Taohe water diversion site to study. Liu Houlu was punished for his mistakes at work, and he is determined to work hard to reform himself in his future work.",

The head teacher was afraid of affecting the children's summer homework review and opposed this suggestion. The counselors and party secretary supported the children's opinions, helped them to study in the steel factory, and invited Zhang Laogong, a veteran worker of the steel factory, to give guidance. The blower was broken, and the headmaster donated the bicycle and converted it into a pedal power machine, so the furnace was built. This small factory was named the Red Scarf Ironworks, and Liu Shuping became the director of the small factory. Under the guidance of Zhang Laogong, the students smelted high-quality gray iron, which was praised in the city's iron-smelting competition. After that, they used crucibles to smelt high-silicon steel overnight, which surprised the old worker Zhang Laogong. For this reason, the Red Scarf Ironworks was turned into a steelworks. Later, they also helped other middle schools build steel-making furnaces.

The conservative deputy director Zhu and engineer Wu thought that the factory equipment was simple and the workers lacked experience, so they didn't believe that they could produce steel. Zhang Peng and others firmly believe that through research, they will surely succeed. With the support of Director Yang, Zhang Peng bought books on steelmaking from the bookstore, and the workers studied steelmaking technology assiduously and actively practiced it. But in the trial, he suffered several failures in a row. For this reason, Zhu, the deputy factory director who was not in favor of steelmaking, accused them of being overjoyed and blind and reckless, and asked the factory director Yang to stop the experiment. Director Yang and the workers summed up the experience and lessons of many failures, and finally succeeded in making steel out of scrap iron. Later, the ironworks decided to expand into a steelworks, requiring an investment of 510,000 yuan, but the superior only allocated 150,000 yuan. Purchaser Yuan Keqin proposed to do big things with less money. With the great assistance of the brother factory, Yuan purchased some old machines, which were repaired by veteran workers Cao Fu and others; Zhang Peng went to the advanced factory to learn steelmaking technology. In this way, a steelmaking plant with an annual output of 300,000 tons was built on the ruins. However, in the process of steelmaking, the problem of running out of steel in the steelmaking furnace appeared again. In order to find out the reason, Director Yang went down the furnace to inspect it himself. After painstaking research by him, Zhang Peng and others, they finally found the reason and smelted the first furnace of steel.",

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "In a remote mountainous area, traffic was extremely difficult in the past. The news came that the heroic railway soldiers came to the mountainous area to build the railway. Although the old blacksmith Huang Taihammer had exceeded the age required to recruit migrant workers, he stubbornly asked to participate in the railway construction work. His daughter Huang Liying is also going to participate, but he disagrees. After Huang Tiechui left, Liying also went secretly. Huang Tiehui joined the ironwork group. Due to his conservative thinking, he simply emphasized quality assurance while ignoring quantity. The production progress was very slow, which made his team fail to meet the competition targets. His conservatism hardened when he saw another group get criticized for focusing on quantity and neglecting quality. Members of the geotechnical engineering team where my daughter works, tried their best to carry out technological innovations and invented the flying box soil transportation method, which greatly improved work efficiency. Later, Huang Tiehammer made progress under the inspiration of his old comrade-in-arms, Chief Chen of the Railway Corps, and moved by his daughter's advanced deeds.",

Wu Liben learned about the difficulties of the competitors, and actively helped them mechanize with small cranes to solve the difficulties of the loading and unloading groups. As the production records of the open hearth furnace workshop and the loading and unloading group continued to be refreshed, the material transportation group could no longer keep up with the production needs only relying on manpower and hundreds of dilapidated vehicles.

The party branch of Jianshe No. 3 oil tanker decided to suspend Lan Feiqing's practice according to the instructions of the superior. At the same time, other oil tankers adopted Zhang Liangcai's approach to solve the periodic chimney fire accidents. Finally, Liu Tong, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Bureau, criticized Lan Feiqing's erroneous ideas of superstitious authority and dogmatism, and promoted Zhang Liangcai's approach.",

When I made a typical report, it caused a roar of laughter. Secretary Zhang of the county party committee criticized Xiaodu for his complacency and encouraged him to rely on the masses and think of ways. After Xiao Du came back, he mobilized the masses to go up the mountain to find spring water, and found the long-dried Longtan spring. He reported to the county with a new target of 200 mu, thinking that he could take off his conservative and typical hat now, but he was even more backward. Other communal plans were not a few hundred mu, but thousands of mu. Annoyed, he returned to the Honghua Club, and immediately called a meeting of the presidents of the various clubs to mobilize the clubs to divert water from the Longtan Spring of the Honghua Club to plant rice. At this time, Secretary Zhang came to Xuefeng Township to inspect the work, and inspired Xiaodu to mobilize the various clubs to go up the mountain to find spring water again. At the same time, news of the spring water found came from various communities near and far. Soon, rice was planted all over the mountains here. At the invitation of Secretary Zhang of the county party committee, Xiaodu went to give a typical report with a new target of 15,000 mu.",

In order to sabotage the fundraising activities, the enemy stole Zhang Shaohua's name and posted a notice prohibiting fundraising, which was exposed by Zhang Shaohua. Then, the enemy ordered the scab Jiang Aliu to secretly put iron filings on the generator, and arrested Zhang Shaohua on the charge of destroying the generator. The enemy used all kinds of torture to force him to admit that he was a member of the Communist Party, so as to destroy the prestige of the Communist Party among the masses. Zhang Shaohua would rather die than surrender. The enemy forged the confession and pressed Zhang Shaohua's fingerprints when he was tortured and unconscious. The party organization exposed the enemy's conspiracy. Commander Tang, the head of the underground party organization in prison, also gave Zhang Shaohua great education and encouragement before his execution; Zhang Shaohua also saw his wife Aqin grow rapidly under the cultivation of the party. All this strengthened his confidence in the struggle. He exposed the enemy's conspiracy in court and was killed by the enemy.",

He and Baihua's machine made excellent results, and with his exemplary behavior, he influenced Zhang Xiulan, who was backward in thinking, and made the group an active promoter of advanced experience. Afterwards, Huang Baomei took the initiative to visit and learn after seeing the advanced deeds of Li Sulan's seven-day {QUOTE}elimination of white spots{QUOTE} in the No. 7 Cotton Factory in the newspaper. After she came back, after several days and nights of thinking about food and sleep, she finally found a joint method to {QUOTE}eliminate white spots{QUOTE}. Afterwards, their group put forward a proposal to eliminate white spots in Banyue. In the arena, Yang Guizhen's team offered a one-day guarantee for eradicating white spots, and Huang Baomei's team offered a five-hour guarantee for eradicating white spots. When Huang Baomei led the group of female workers to fight against time, Yang Guizhen came to ask Huang Baomei to teach the method of {QUOTE}eliminating white spots{QUOTE}. Xia Peifang of the yellow group was afraid that the red flag of the competition would be taken away by the opponent, and opposed Huang Baomei's teaching experience. Huang persuaded Xia Peifang to go to Yang Guizhen's group to teach her experience. As a result, not only did not affect her group's plan, but she completed the task of eliminating white spots ahead of schedule within four and a half hours. Huang Baomei also helped Yang Guizhen's team surpass her own. Then, with the support and help of comrades in the party branch and group, she created the {QUOTE}ingot-by-ingot maintenance{QUOTE} method, and was elected as a national model worker, and honorably attended the eighth meeting of the party.",

The young worker Xiao Du, the young technician Xiao Mei and engineer Zhu worked hard for 12 days and nights, and finally found the key problem in the operation technology, mastered the properties of manganese, and trial-produced the first batch of manganese copper wire. When Xiao Du and Engineer Zhu took the newly produced manganese copper wire to the chief engineer of the instrument factory to test whether it met the specifications, the chief engineer thought that their operation method lacked theoretical basis and did not conform to scientific laws, so he refused to test. Xiao Du and Engineer Zhu went to two small laboratories for testing, and the result was that one said it was good, and the other said it was not. Afterwards, they went to Section Chief Yang, who said that the manganese copper wire produced by Tongren Factory was an imported old product in stock, and asked the chief engineer to test it.

Thus launched the ideological struggle between advanced and conservative. Later, under the party's education and workers' criticism, Yu Duanchang overcame his conservative thinking. After investigation, research and field measurements, he proposed to the railway bureau that the speed of crossings should be increased to 45 kilometers per hour on detours and 90 kilometers on straight roads.

Secretary Xu of the District Party Committee criticized their mistakes. After four nights of hard work, the leaky hole was filled. When the young seedlings were growing vigorously, they encountered continuous drought. Zhang Dingguo led the members to fight the drought. Then, there was heavy rain and waterlogging. Regardless of the danger, Zhang Dingguo and Li Anbang jumped into the water, opened the gate, and drained the accumulated water, resulting in a bumper rice harvest.

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "In 1948, our Northeast Field Army launched an autumn offensive. Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly dispatched five armies for reinforcements in an attempt to rescue the besieged Jiang army in the northeast. A column of our Northeast Field Army was on the front line of Montenegro in the cold weather, lack of food and ammunition, blocking an enemy force five times its own. The enemy used the 101 Heights as a breakthrough, and they used the common people as shields to advance, and concentrated their forces to carry out a storm. In order not to harm the people, our army engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. At the most brutal stage of the battle, the staff of the column headquarters also took up arms and participated in the battle. The commander of the column personally went to the front of the position to command, was seriously injured, and the guards also died honorably. The political commissar of the column commanded the battle instead of the commander, and finally repelled the attack of the enemy's reinforcements. After annihilating the enemy forces in the Northeast, they worked with the main force to encircle and wipe out the reinforcements.",

Zeng Tai, the chief of the reconnaissance section of our army, based on the clues of the confession of the deputy commander of the bandit army who has been captured by our army, pretended to be the deputy commander who had just crossed the border from abroad and went deep into the bandit's nest. Due to the delay of the scheduled joint date, the suspicion of the bandit leader Li Yuegui was aroused. Li Yuegui asked Zeng Tai to interrogate her trusted secret service leader as a captured PLA soldier. Zeng Tai saw through the enemy's tricks, killed the fake captives, and passed the difficulty of the first inspection. Soon, Li Yuegui sent Zeng Tai to lead some bandits to harass the Shahewei area where our army is conducting a pilot land reform. Zeng Tai came up with a way to neither make the enemy doubt himself nor cause the masses to suffer losses, and sent the information through the liaison officer, the old hunter, to overcome the difficulty of the second inspection. After Shahewei returned from defeat, Cyclops, the bandit leader, reported Zeng Tai's confession to the old hunter to Li Bandit and his wife. Zeng Tai cleverly used Li Yuegui's confidant, Ms. Alan, to use offense as defense, and killed Cyclops with Li Hanguang's knife, breaking through the difficulty of the third inspection. Li Yuegui sent people to arrest the old hunter and cut off Zeng Tai's contact point. Political Commissar Ma of our army sent Geng Hao, a reconnaissance staff officer, into the bandit's nest. According to the report of No. 49 secret agent hidden in our army, Li Bandit mistakenly believed that Geng Hao was Zeng Tai, arrested Geng Hao, and asked Zeng Tai to interrogate himself. In order to help Zeng Tai complete the task, Geng Hao insisted that he was Zeng Tai, and helped Zeng Tai overcome the difficulty of the fourth inspection. In the end, Zeng Tai won the trust of Bandit Li, took control of the army, and risked letting Geng Hao and the old hunter go. Geng Hao died while delivering the information.

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "1939 was the most difficult period of the Anti-Japanese War. In order to strengthen the work of Shanghai's underground radio station, the Party Central Committee sent Li Xia, a veteran Long March cadre and political commissar of the radio station, from Yan'an to Shanghai to work in the heart of the enemy. In order to cover Li Xia, He Lanfen, a female textile worker and member of the Shanghai underground party, and Li Xia pretended to be husband and wife. In a difficult environment, they fell in love, and after being approved by the leaders, they became husband and wife. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Li Xia was unfortunately arrested by the Japanese army. Soon after, Li Xia was released by the Japanese army on suspicion that he was sent by the Chongqing Kuomintang. After he was released from prison, Yao Wei, an underground member of the Kuomintang, also mistook Li Xia for a commercial radio station staff of a certain important person in Chongqing, and wanted to pull Li Xia into the water to work in the radio station for an important KMT official who was negotiating surrender terms in Shanghai and Japan. Li Xia went deep into the tiger's lair to steal important information from the enemy. Only when the inside story of the enemy's negotiation was exposed in the newspaper did he realize that he had been fooled by Li Xia. At this time Li Xia had moved elsewhere. On the eve of liberation, the enemy frantically searched for underground radio stations in Shanghai, and Li Xia was ordered to transfer. At this moment, there are two urgent and important pieces of information that must be sent out immediately, and Li Xia volunteered to carry out this important task. He had prepared for the worst and ordered his wife He Lanfen to transfer with his son. When he just finished sending the content of the telegram, the enemy had surrounded his house, and he calmly sent a final farewell signal to Yan'an.",

Lan Ying and Xiao Li, young workers in the engine workshop, posted big-character posters to their master, Wang Wanshui, a well-known model worker in the country, criticizing Wang Wanshui for having old ideas. Liu Zijian, Secretary of the Party Committee of the factory, visited Chief Engineer Xing for the manufacture of internal combustion engines. Xing has an admiration for foreign ideas, and believes that a 3,000-horsepower internal combustion engine cannot be produced in his own country. Just at this time, a country in Western Europe was willing to sell internal combustion engine blueprints to my country. Liu Wenxun went to Beijing, but the negotiation failed because the other party's conditions were too harsh. In this case, the shipyard workers and technicians combined to design the blueprint of the internal combustion engine in less than a month. With the help of Soviet expert Simonov, they overcame many difficulties, and finally, on the eve of the National Day, the trial voyage was successful.",

Yu Liping was deeply moved and rushed to the hospital to review her mistakes to Ding Shuping. Soon, Ding Shuping went to the seaside to recuperate. During this period, Ding Shuping discovered that Luo Lin, the singer she loved, was silently in love with Yu Liping, and she decided to give up her feelings for Luo. When Yu Liping knew the secret, she was very distressed, and also intentionally distanced herself from Luo. After Ding Shuping returned from recuperation, she criticized Yu Liping and made Yu and Luo reconcile. Later, Ding Shuping fell in love with Wang Dongyan's elder brother Wang Dongzhou. A year later, Ding Shuping, Yu Liping, and Wang Dongyan participated in the National Ice Games together. Yu deliberately let Ding win the 500-meter championship.

The leaders of Baiyun Township, Wang Kai and Hou Jinbiao, are determined to divert water from the Yellow River to the high mountains on the north bank. Under the unified command of the county party committee, farmers on the north bank overcame many difficulties to build a water delivery project across the Yellow River, and the project progressed rapidly. Qingshui Township on the south bank is not short of water, and Ding Fugui, the leader of Qingshui Township, is not very enthusiastic about blasting mountains and opening canals. Twenty years ago, Ding inspected Heihu Mountain for the canal repair, and was thrown half to death. Wang Kai's father died in Heihu Mountain for the canal repair. Now the project of Heihu Mountain that Ding is in charge of is delayed for some reason. In order to start the Heihushan project quickly, Wang Kai led migrant workers from Baiyun Township to support Ding Fugui. After repeated failures in crossing the Yellow River, Wang Kai invited the experienced Ding Fugui. At first, Ding refused to go out. Encouraged by his daughter Xiu'e, he came out to fight the Black Tiger Wave with his son Juncai, crossed the natural danger of the Yellow River, and blasted his foothold on the Black Tiger Mountain. During an explosion, the safety rope on Juncai's waist broke, and he fell down the mountain. Wang Kai bravely hugged Juncai, jumped into the Yellow River from the mountain, and Juncai was rescued. With the cooperation of farmers on both sides of the north and south banks, the Black Tiger Mountain was finally blasted, and a large aqueduct across the Yellow River was built to divert water across the Yellow River to irrigate the dry land.",

When Xiaodou helped the Shanjiao Society to survey the water level of the power station, he found that the water level difference between the two communities was large, and he had to divert the river water from the Shayuan Society. Tian Youliang, who has egocentric thoughts, wants to use the water of the Shayuan River to build a reservoir so that the river water can serve the Shayuan Society. However, Xiaodou considered the overall situation and proposed a plan for the two communities to jointly build reservoirs and share water and electricity, which was rejected by Tian Youliang.

After conducting an on-the-spot test, he found that Chen Sanliang's handwriting was similar to that of his elder sister Li Suping.

After liberation, Jianhua signed up to join the Volunteer Army to resist US aggression and aid Korea. After being demobilized and returning to China, he worked on the construction site of the Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhan. He was on the same construction site as his biological father Wang Zhengting and his younger sister A Xiang, but they did not know each other. The people's police learned that Wang Zhengting and his wife had the hidden pain of selling their children, so they went to investigate Bao'er's whereabouts on their behalf, and finally visited Zhou Mama in Suzhou.

Ayi Muhan refused to join forces, so the whole family was dissatisfied with her. Ayi Muhan and the director of the cooperative, Balati, once fell in love when they were young, and now they often get in touch with each other because of their work. Her sister-in-law, Mai Laimuhan, tried to tell lies, and Ayi Muhan was severely beaten by her husband. Then, Mai Laimuhan deliberately lent the wheat to Balati's wife, Zarehan wheat, to cover up Nurdin's crime of illegal food trafficking, and took the opportunity to tell the truth, which caused conflicts in the Balati family. Zao Rehan believes that her husband is having an affair with Ayi Muhan, and angrily returns to live with her natal family. Hidden counter-revolutionaries Yu Layin and Yi Min Yaxing took advantage of the selfishness of Tuohuti and other backward peasants to incite them to quit the cooperative. Nurdin led people to rob the commune of grain and livestock, but Ayimuhan came out to dissuade him and was injured by her husband. At this time Balati arrived and persuaded the crowd. Yimin Yaxing took away Ayi Muhan under the pretext of Balati and instigated Nurdin to assassinate Balati in an attempt to create a bigger riot. Their conspiracy was heard by Mai Laimuhan. She was afraid that the matter would expand to her own disadvantage, so she immediately reported it to Ayi Muhan. The enemy's plot was foiled. In the end, Ayimuhan persuaded Zaorehan to return to Balati's arms. She divorced her husband, Nurdin, and was sent to a training class by the organization.",

Later, when he saw his son destroying the Japanese gunboat, he realized that he had blamed his son.

Because he was penniless, he saw an empty sedan chair parked in front of the inn, so he went in to rest. At dawn, he suddenly saw that he had been carried to a deserted temple, and heard some people whispering, so he knew that Lanmusi had mistaken him for a yellow girl.

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "More than a hundred years ago, British imperialism imported a large amount of opium into China, poisoning tens of thousands of Chinese people. At that time, Emperor Daoguang Minning of the Qing Dynasty felt that the consequences would be serious, so he specially appointed Lin Zexu, the leader of the anti-smoking faction, as the imperial envoy to Guangzhou to ban opium. The leader of the anti-smoking opposition, Mu Zhang'a, Minister of Military Affairs, and Qi Shan, Governor of Zhili, secretly wrote to Yu Kun, the governor of Guangdong Customs in Guangzhou, and secretly sabotaged it. Yukun sent people to report the matter to Diandi, the largest British opium dealer in Guangzhou. After Lin Zexu arrived in Guangzhou, he joined forces with Deng Tingzhen, the governor of Guangdong and Guangxi, and Guan Tianpei, the admiral of the Guangzhou Navy, to renovate the dilapidated coastal defenses and prepare to fight against the aggression of British imperialism. The law urged the British merchants to hand over all the opium and tobacco. After Lin Zexu burned more than 20,000 boxes of opium in Humen, Elliot wrote to the British Foreign Secretary, suggesting that the British government quickly implement the war plan for aggression against China that had been drawn up long ago. In May 1840, the British government launched the Opium War of aggression against China. The British army could not attack Guangzhou, so they moved north to attack Tianjin and threaten Beijing. Daoguang Emperor Min Ning was afraid of the British army. In the name of Lin Zexu's failure to ban smoking, he dismissed Lin Zexu from his post as an imperial envoy and sent Qi Shan to Guangzhou to handle the matter of surrender. At this time, Guan Tianpei had no choice but to fight against the British army alone, and died heroically in Humen. Then, Emperor Daoguang dispatched Lin Zexu to Xinjiang. The British invading army was not satisfied, and continued to expand the war of aggression against China, and the flames of war burned from the coast to the interior. Under the leadership of the fisherman Kuang Dongshan, the people of Sanyuanli, Guangzhou fought a heroic battle with the British army.",

In a fit of anger, Zhao Songyun took his luggage and went to the city to find Director Li of the Finance Committee. Director Li helped the two reconcile, and Zhao Songyun returned to the farm. Once, bandits robbed the food of the people in a nearby village, and the commander of the battlefield led his troops to get the food back for the people. In autumn, the wheat on the farm is ripe, and the nearby people help the farm to harvest the wheat. The wheat on the farm has a bumper harvest.

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "The Yang Mansion in Tianbo is adorned with lanterns and festoons, and a feast is held to celebrate the 50th birthday of Yang Zongbao, who was stationed in the frontier. Jiao Tinggui and Meng Dingguo, two frontier guards in the Northern Song Dynasty, came to report the news of Yang Zongbao's death in the frontier. Zongbao's wife, Mu Guiying, was distraught and wanted to report to Madam She, requesting to send troops to avenge her husband immediately. The mother-in-law, Princess Chai, was afraid that the hundred-year-old matriarch would not be able to withstand this heavy blow, so she discussed with Guiying to hide the news for the time being. At the banquet, Mrs. She saw that Jiao and Meng Erjiang were hesitant to talk to the princess, Guiying's mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and their expressions were restless, which aroused suspicion. After repeated questioning, the straightforward Jiao Tinggui had to tell the truth. Immediately, Madam She and all the female generals of the Yang family were stunned. The old matriarch sprinkled wine to worship the loyal soul, and wanted to avenge Zongbao temporarily. Emperor Renzong of the Northern Song Dynasty spends his days in the harem for pleasure and entertainment, and does not care about state affairs. Taijun She was extremely anxious, and asked Jiao and Meng Erjiang to invite the emperor's uncle Baxian Wang and his younger brother Anle Wang Zuozhi to the emperor. Renzong was shocked when he heard the news, and accompanied by King Baxian and King Anle, he went to Yang Mansion to pay homage in person. In front of the spirit, the Baxian King used aggressive methods to make Guiying and his fifteen-year-old boy Yang Wenguang request to go out for revenge, but Princess Chai came out to stop him. Renzong had no choice but to meet Madam She in person. Under the repeated persuasion of Renzong and others, Taijun She decided to personally lead the expedition in order to protect the country and the people. Princess Chai was afraid that something would happen to Wen Guang, so after killing the Yang family, he would not let Wen Guang go out with the army. She Taijun asked Wen Guang to compete with his mother Guiying to test Guiying's attitude. In order to realize Wen Guang's pure heart of avenging his father, Gui Ying deliberately loses to Wen Guang. Taijun She took command at the age of one hundred and led her great-grandson Yang Wenguang and all the female generals of the Yang family to the expedition. Wang Wen of Xixia set up a strategy to lure troops, trying to lure the generals of the Yang family into the mouth of the gourd and kill them all. However, Taijun She and the heroine Mu Guiying, who have been on the battlefield for a long time, saw through it. Taijun She took advantage of the plan, deliberately showed weakness, made the Fan soldiers proud, and then lured the enemy to go deep. Wang Wen found out that he was tricked, and desperately resisted, trying to hurt Wen Guang with an arrow from behind, but Mu Guiying, who was quick-sighted and quick-handed, caught the arrow. Wen Guang killed Wang Wen and avenged his father. Taijun She defeated the enemy soldiers and returned to the court victorious.",

Once, Senguan Lin was followed by spy Li Boguang on the way to transport weapons. Senguan took advantage of Li's inattention and knocked Li into the middle of the river. Seeing someone falling into the water, the old helmsman Ngawang exclaimed. When he found out that Sen Guan was at the scene when the accident happened, he stopped making a sound. Afterwards, Ngawang was detained by the enemy for interrogation and torture, but he still refused to tell the truth. Taking advantage of Ngawang's belief in Catholicism, the enemy instigated the priest to trick him into confessing the truth. Sen Guan was about to go into the church to inquire about the news, but met Li Boguang who had fallen into the water halfway, so Sen Guan was stopped by the spies and went to a restaurant. After a fierce ideological struggle, Ngawang did not tell the truth, and the enemy's trick failed. Soon, Senguan accepted the task of delivering a batch of weapons. The spy chief Wang Xun personally led two ships to follow the freighter. On the way, an enemy security team disguised as a guerrilla suddenly appeared and unloaded the weapons ashore under the pretext of searching the ship. At this time, the following enemy ship was approaching. In a critical moment, Ngawang drove the ship alone to ram the enemy ship, and died together with the enemy, keeping the underground route.",

Fifteen years later, Chen Xiang grew up and learned martial arts from Daxian.

Unexpectedly, her daughter was beaten to death by Dongyang Po. The death of Xiao Zhenzi aroused the anger of the workers, and they asked the Japanese capitalists for better treatment. At this time, news came that Gu Zhenghong, a worker's representative, had been shot dead, so the workers went on strike under the leadership of the party. The capitalists broke the strike, kidnapped Yang Guiying, and forced Yang to announce in public that her daughter was not killed by the Orientals, and that the Communist Party deliberately instigated the strike. Yang Guiying falsely promised, but at the press conference, she exposed the enemy's conspiracy in public, making the enemy embarrassed. When the enemy was about to kill her, the workers rushed into the factory, rescued Yang Guiying, and set off a magnificent {QUOTE}May 30th{QUOTE} anti-imperialist movement.",

Bai Shouren often violated the discipline of the masses, beating and scolding soldiers, sowing dissension, and the political commissar patiently helped him. Not only did he show no repentance, but he also secretly colluded with Ha Shaofu to plot rebellion. During the hospitalization of the political commissar, Bai You lynched and tortured the cadres of the peasant association, which demoralized the army, and many people deserted, and the horse fought against them. Later, Bai Shouren tricked the team away and prepared to surrender to the Japanese invaders. Ma Benzhai resolutely beat Bai Shouren to death. Soon, Ma Ma was captured by the enemy and died generously. Commissar Guo was also killed in the battle. Before he died, he approved Ma Benzhai's request to join the party.

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "In the spring of 1949, the People's Liberation Army advanced to Shanghai. The 300,000 Jiang army entrenched in Shanghai tried to make a desperate struggle with American equipment and favorable terrain. A certain military commander of our Third Field Army, in order to protect the city buildings and the lives and properties of six million citizens, took advantage of the factional conflicts within the Jiang army, and first wiped out the well-equipped Jiang army's direct descendant, Shao Zhuang, to the periphery. At this time, the enemy Commander Tang ordered Liu Yi, a non-directed lineage, to defend the urban area. Our Shanghai Underground Party cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to eliminate the spies who attempted to destroy the city. When our army forcibly crossed the Suzhou Creek, Liu Yi, the enemy defending on the other side of the river, relied on the favorable terrain of high-rise buildings, which repeatedly frustrated our attacking troops. On the one hand, our army adopts roundabout tactics, and on the other hand, it launches a political offensive against the defending enemy. Liu Yi is an old traitor, knowing that Jiang rejects dissidents, and is unwilling to die. Now that the situation is over, he wants to surrender, but he is worried because his hands are stained with the blood of massacring Communists. In the end, under my strong military pressure and political offensive, he was killed Force an uprising.",

She lived in peace for 20 years, when King An of Liaodong rebelled. Taijun She was concerned about the safety of the country, and ordered her great-grandsons Yang Wenguang and Yang Jinhua to go to Bianliang, the capital, to find out the news. It happened that the king of song was selecting generals in the school field. The treacherous minister Wang Qiang offered to the king of song to protect his son Wang Lun as the marshal. Song Wang originally thought that after the Yang family died out, he didn't expect that there was such a martial artist Yang Wenguang, and after learning that the heroine Mu Guiying was still alive, he made Mu Guiying the Generalissimo of the Eastern Expedition and ordered Wenguang to bring back the seal of command. Guiying hated the king of Song for being fatuous and treacherous ministers in power, and refused to accept the seal. Madam She told her the principles of safeguarding the country and keeping the people safe, and Guiying then regrouped and sent troops to wipe out the rebels. Before leaving, Mrs. She went to the school grounds to bid farewell. Mu Guiying led a large army and marched towards the frontier.

Zhu Laogong died of hatred, and his son Huzi was forced to flee his hometown. Twenty-five years later, Zhu Laozhong (Hu Zi) led his family back to his hometown from outside the pass to avenge his father. Soon, his son Dagui was arrested by Feng Lanchi to become a young man. Introduced by Wu Laoba, an underground party member, Zhu Laozhong got acquainted with Jia Xiangnong, the leader of the underground party, and learned a lot of revolutionary truths. He united the suffering farmers and started a fight against Feng Lanchi. After 1927, the revolution turned into a low ebb, and Feng Lanchi exploited the peasants even more cruelly.

Liang Zhiping, the deputy director, advocated expanding the factory and adding equipment. In order to solve the difficulties of the oxygen plant, Deputy Director Liang asked Wu Jian (Tian's lover), the director of the machinery factory, to increase the three sets of oxygen equipment originally planned for the oxygen plant to twelve; Problem, Liang also asked Wang Qun (Liang's fiancée), director of the Supply and Marketing Department of the Bureau, to allocate raw materials for supporting other provinces to the machine factory. Wang Qun agreed with Tian Fang and criticized Liang for his right-leaning conservative thinking. For this reason, the two clashed. Wu Jian complained that Tian Fang didn't understand the difficulties of their factory because the bureau had added dozens of sets of rolling mill production tasks to the machine factory. Tian pointed out that Jin Dahai and Zhu Yongxiang's technological innovation proposals are the solution to the difficulties. Later, Zhu Dongsheng's technological innovation in the oxygen plant suffered setbacks, and Liang decided to stop the experiment. Tian criticized Liang's mistake and continued to support the experiment. Subsequently, Zhu Yongxiang's test of calcium carbide substitutes in the machine factory also had an explosion accident.

Eighteen years later, Mihan's daughter Elihan grows up and falls in love with Yanwen, a turned poor peasant. At this time, Xishuangbanna was in the early days of liberation, but the feudal forces of the headmen had not yet been eliminated. Unwilling to give up exploitation, the old trumpet sees that Yanwen has joined the working group, holds a grudge, and colludes with the big boss Zhaoyan Pasha to marry the widow's daughter Nansu to Yanwen, hoping to bribe him.

This group used to have poor unity and often failed to complete production tasks. After Zhou Yuzhen came to the group, she mobilized and united the workers in the whole group with her own practical actions. Female worker Xie Jinfang has low ideological awareness, low production motivation, and often produces waste products. Zhou took the initiative to help her, but encountered many setbacks. Once, Jin Fang fell ill, and the comrades in the group took turns to make up for her. Zhou personally visited Jin Fang's home to recall the bitterness and sweetness, which inspired Jin Fang to raise her consciousness. Zhou also gave Jin Fang her well-maintained lathe . Later, both Jin Fang and the team won the red flag, and Zhou was named the Shanghai Red Flag Youth Assaulter.",

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "In 1950, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army marched into the Keshan area of ​​Tibet. In order to wait for the awakening of the Tibetan minority leaders, they did not immediately implement democratic reforms. Under the leadership of Commander Yang Fan, the troops help the Tibetans in construction and benefit the Tibetans. The Tibet Hexia reactionary group sent special agent Luo Jia to Keshan, colluded with Kelu Yade, the chieftain of Keshan, and became an enemy of the People's Liberation Army. Ke's wife, Jia Luo, ordered the special agent Luo's family to capture Yang Fan's lover Huang Ying and the correspondent, forcing the People's Liberation Army to detain Ke and create an excuse for rebellion. But Yang Fan did not detain Ke, and the spy's plot failed. The Luo family planned to invite Yang Fan to the mountain for a banquet. Yang Dayi was awe-inspiring, so he went to the mountain to go to the banquet, and persuaded Ke to repent. Ke's wife, Jia Luoxia, used force to threaten Yang and order the army to withdraw from Keshan. At that time, the People's Liberation Army had already surrounded the cottage, and Ke saw that the situation was not good, so he had to let Yang go down the mountain. In order to provoke the rebellion, the Luo family shot and killed the captured correspondent of our army and launched a rebellion openly. Ke threatened Chieftain Luoka to rebel, and tried to buy Huang Ying. Huang was tortured and unyielding. In the end, the People's Liberation Army was forced to take military action to quell the rebellion, rescued Huang Ying, and liberated the serfs in Keshanzhai.",

Xiucai picked up a copper coin from the ground, Lin Se said that he lost the penny, but the scholar refused to give it back, Lin Se took the copper coin and pretended that the money had been swallowed. Xiucai went to the county government to sue. The county magistrate heard that it was a money case, and thought there was a lot of stolen goods to be greedy. He first gave Xiucai a full meal in an attempt to collude with Xiucai and blackmail Lin Se. But Xiucai didn't understand the intention of the magistrate. When the magistrate asked the case, he said that he only wanted a penny. The county magistrate was very annoyed, but in order not to lose the practice of obtaining stolen goods in the case, he ordered that a penny in Lin Se's belly be poured out with cold water so that he could put it into his private pocket. The rich man's wife was afraid of hurting her husband, so she reluctantly handed over a penny and begged for mercy. The county magistrate used this to blackmail, insisting that Lin Se swallowed ten ingots and asked him to guarantee compensation. Lin Po asked the county magistrate to have a laparotomy. If there is no ingot, the county magistrate will pay for it. The county magistrate had no choice but to drive the plaintiff and the defendant out of court together to settle the case.",

Soon, her husband Zhao Bin was killed, and their son, who was under one year old, was rescued by an old Uighur. Eighteen years later, Meng Ying returned to Xinjiang and was sent to a construction site of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway as party secretary. During the construction process, there was a Moding Mountain blocking the progress of the project. Ai Li, a bulldozer driver, put forward a proposal to split mountains and build roads, but was sabotaged by hidden counter-revolutionary Wang Dong and opposed by Captain Maimaiti. Ai Li desperately went up the mountain to explore the road, and almost made a mistake. Captain Maimaiti actually wanted to fire Ai Li. Meng Ying criticized Maimaiti's right-leaning ideology, decided to get through Moding Mountain, and handed over the first climbing task to Ai Li. At this time, Ai Li's grandfather and the president of the commune, Asim, arrived and asked Meng Ying to go to someone else, and told Ai Li's life experience. It turned out that President Asim was the old Uighur who rescued the child, and Ai Li was the rescued child, but Meng Ying resolutely handed over the climbing task to Ai Li. Later, the hidden counter-revolutionary Wang Dong was caught, and the railway passed through Moding Mountain. The county party secretary Alamu Khan came to congratulate her. She was a Uighur girl who was in prison with Meng Ying eighteen years ago. Allie was very excited to recognize his biological mother.",

Seeing this scene, Zhang Zhengwu accused Yulan of not making raincoats. Later, Qin Keming helped solve the technical problems of production.

At this time, Dahai's hometown was hit by floods, and the paratroopers accepted the disaster relief mission, but Dahai was not allowed to participate. The instructor agreed to his participation only after his repeated requests. With the help of leaders and comrades, Dahai completed the airdrop disaster relief mission. Since then, Lin Dahai has made rapid progress and finally became an excellent paratrooper of the People's Liberation Army.",

Later, under the instruction of Xu Kang, secretary of the county party committee, and the persuasion of Qin Guilan, the new female deputy factory director and secretary of the party branch, He Zhuang, the foreman, was reluctantly sent to support the Lingnan factory. After the competition between the two factories, the Lingbei factory's production declined due to poor ore quality. Factory Manager Fan only pursues personal achievements, and insists on transferring He Zhuang back despite the fact that Lingnan Factory is in great need of technical guidance. Later, under the education of Secretary Xu, He Zhuang admitted his mistake and reunited with Guilan. Secretary Xu finally recognized He Zhuang as his son who had been separated for more than 20 years. Soon, due to floods breaking the river bridge, the Lingnan factory was short of food. Factory Manager Fan refused to borrow food for support. Guilan severely criticized Fan's mistakes and mobilized the people in Lingbei to borrow food to support Lingnan, and Lingnan also sent people to support Lingbei to solve the ore problem. Under Guilan's criticism and factual education, Director Fan realized his mistake and took up the post of learning.

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "Scholar Liu Yi fails the exam. On his way home, he meets Sanniang, a dragon girl in Dongting. Sanniang tells him that she was abused by her husband Jinghe Xiaolong. Liu Yi sympathized with what happened to Sanniang, so he ran thousands of miles to Dongting Lake to deliver the letter. Although Mr. Dongting felt sorry for his daughter, he did not dare to send troops. His younger brother Qiantang Jun heard the news. Immediately, he wanted to kill Ben Jinghe and rescue his niece Sanniang. Lord Dongting was afraid of causing trouble, so he stopped him. Liu Yi insisted on the reason for sending troops, and Lord Qiantang thought Liu Yi's words were justified, so he resolutely led his troops to the Jinghe River, got rid of Xiaolong, and rescued Sanniang.{LINE_CUT} Lord Dongting hosted a banquet to thank Liu Yi for his kindness in passing on the letter, and Lord Qiantang wanted to betroth Sanniang to him. Liu Yi thinks that Shi En Tu Bao is a villain, so he politely refuses.{LINE_CUT} When Liu Yi left, the three mothers saw him off. Along the way, Liu Yi was gradually moved by using scenes to describe his feelings. At the time of parting, Sanniang presented them with shark pearls.{LINE_CUT} Sanniang and Dongting Lord then turned into fishermen's father and daughter and came to the world, and Sangu, who was transformed into Sanniang, recognized Liu Mu as her godmother. When Liu Yi came back, every time he saw Sangu, he thought of Sanniang, and heard the old fisherman's story about the marriage of the Dragon King of Dongting, so he came to the lake to congratulate Sanniang. Sanniang floated out of the tide, while Sangu also rushed to the lake. Liu Yi was surprised to see that the two looked exactly alike. When he saw Sanniang and Sangu turned into one person, he woke up like a dream, and the two formed a happy relationship.",

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "During the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, when Lin Chong, the head of the 800,000 forbidden army in Bianliang, Tokyo, and his wife went to burn incense in the temple, they ran into Gao Shide, the son of the powerful minister Gao Qiu. Qian stopped him, so he had to swallow his anger and give up. In order to occupy Mrs. Lin, Gao Shide asked his father to assign Lin Chong to Cangzhou. In order to eradicate the troubles, Gao Qiu also ordered his disciple Lu Qian to pay off his errand, and killed Lin Chong on the way. Two escorts escorted Lin Chong to the wild boar forest and were about to commit an attack when the hero Lu Zhishen appeared and rescued Lin Chong. Lu Zhishen persuaded Lin Chong to return to Tokyo to kill Gao Qiu. Lin Chong refused Lu's kindness, and he was willing to send him out in order to be pardoned and return to his hometown in the future.{LINE_CUT} Gao Qiu was very angry when he learned that Lin Chong had been rescued, and ordered Lu Qian to lead his strong servants to Cangzhou to murder Lin Chong. Unexpectedly, because of the collapse of his house, Lin Chong temporarily moved to live in the Shanshen Temple instead of the forage field. So Lu Qian met Lin Chong in the mountain temple. After a fierce fight, all the servants were killed. Just as Lin Chong raised his knife to kill Lu Qian, Lu Zhishen came to tell Lin Chong that his wife was forced to commit suicide by Gao Qiu. Lin Chong was so angry when he heard the news that he immediately killed Lu Qian and fled to Liangshan with Lu Zhishen.",

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "Gu Qing, a general of our army, accidentally met Li Guoqing, a prisoner of war released by me for the second time, in the Great Hall of the People, which aroused a meaningful memory for Gu Qing.{LINE_CUT} In the spring of 1946, after the signing of the Armistice Agreement, the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang entered into peace talks. General Gu Qing, the representative of the CCP, was ordered to come to Peiping to participate in the military mediation work composed of the country, the Communist Party, and the United States. At the negotiating table, Gu confronted General Fei Ding, the representative of the United States, and Li Guoqing, the representative of Jiang, to expose the collusion between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, and the conspiracy of pretending peace and preparing for war. Intellectuals such as Yenching University professor Xie Hong have illusions about the United States. While Feidin was talking about peace, the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin and the Kuomintang army attacked Anping Town, our liberated area, in order to put pressure on me and try to make me surrender. After the defeat of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, the conspiracy failed. In order to control public opinion, the United States ordered Li Guoqing to hold a press conference overnight, trying to blame me for breaking the peace talks and announce it to the world. At the meeting, Professor Xie Hong's unmarried son-in-law, Xue Ping, a reporter from our Xinhua News Agency, raised serious questions and was kidnapped by the spies. Then, when the special team organized for the {QUOTE}Anping Incident{QUOTE} went to the site of the accident to conduct on-the-spot investigations, I exposed the clumsy tricks played by the US and Chiang Kai-shek. The CCP personnel withdrew to the liberated areas one after another. When Gu Ping left Beijing, Xue Ping had already been rescued by me. Professor Xie, who had had illusions about the United States, also recognized right and wrong, raised his consciousness, and joined the anti-American demonstration team.",

Kurban, a young laborer of Usman's family, deeply sympathized with Anahan's experience and helped her escape from the tiger's mouth. Soon, the news came that the People's Liberation Army had entered Xinjiang, and Usman turned himself into a religious figure. In order to win people's hearts, he expressed his willingness to dissolve the marriage contract with Anahan, and he would not pursue the matter of Kurban letting Anahan go. He just drove Kurban out of Wu's house. Anahan and Kurban were forced to live far from home. In the second year, Anahan's hometown was liberated, and she and her husband Kurban returned to their hometown. Usman persecuted Anahan and Kurban on the charge of treason against religion. Kurban threw himself into the river while escaping. Anahan also committed suicide by diving, but was rescued by the wealthy middle peasant Maimaiti. Maimaiti took the opportunity to propose to Anahan, but after being rejected, he locked her in the orchard and cut off contact with the outside world. Soon, Kurban joined the work team and returned to the village to reduce rent and interest. Usman made use of Maimat's weakness in character and his desire to marry Anaham to create conflicts between him and Kurban, and then ordered someone to murder Maimat, and blamed Kurban class, to stir up dissatisfaction among the masses towards the work team.

Yang Zongbao broke through on his own. Turn back to the capital and ask for reinforcements. Unexpectedly, no one in the court was suitable to take command of the expedition, so the king of Song had to order Zhao Defang, the eight virtuous king, and Kou Zhun, the official of heaven, to dispatch troops to Tianbo Yang's mansion. She Taijun said that the Yang family had no soldiers to transfer and declined. The honest eight sage kings didn't know what to do, and the sophisticated old Kou must have seen the reason, so he lured the old lady into the back hall to prepare a banquet for them, and dragged the eight sage kings into the back garden to perform martial arts Looking into the hall, I saw that the knives, guns, swords and halberds were arranged neatly in the garden, and the horseshoe prints were in disorder, all of which were newly stepped. The two sounded the gold and beat the drum, and they saw Mu Guiying in full body clothes, leading the male and female soldiers of the Yang family into the martial arts hall majesticly. Commander Kou explained to Guiying about the trapping of Hongzhou that Guiying was very angry and wanted to come forward, but hesitated for a moment. The witty Kou Zhun used aggressive methods to arouse Guiying's patriotic enthusiasm again. Just as Guiying stepped forward to accept the seal of command, Madam She hurried to stop her, revealing the truth that Guiying was pregnant. The Baxian King and Kou Zhun were both stunned. When they were anxious and disappointed, Guiying resolutely stepped forward for the safety of the Song Dynasty and accepted the seal of command. At this time, the old lady also encouraged Gui Ying to fight the enemy bravely and win the victory as soon as possible. Then, under the guise of rewarding Zongbao with royal wine, Kou Zhun put the gold seal of the vanguard official on the tray to ask him to take over, and sneaked away with the Eight Sage Kings by himself. When Guiying ordered soldiers at the school grounds, Zongbao didn't know that his wife was a marshal, so he wasted time. Guiying also didn't know that the first officer who was wrongly employed was his husband, and there was a misunderstanding. Guiying led the troops to the city of Hongzhou, Zongbao played a prank, deliberately did not report the situation, and made a joke about the Weng and his daughter-in-law meeting in the big tent. Zong Bao was laughing while clapping his hands. At this time, inside and outside the tent, his wife and father summoned him to accuse him of ignoring the report. Zuo came to fight during the day, but Zongbao ignored Guiying's strategy of using troops and led the troops to fight privately, but returned in a big defeat. Guiying questioned him, but instead of admitting his mistake, he blamed Guiying for being afraid of the enemy soldiers and not daring to fight. Guiying was anxious and ordered to be dealt with according to military law, but immediately hinted that the family soldiers were homesick and asked her father-in-law to come out to intercede. Unexpectedly, Zongbao became more and more proud, and Guiying had no choice but to beat him with forty army sticks. Afterwards, Gui Ying showed great righteousness to Zong Bao, and Zong Bao realized his wife's kindness. At this time, Bai Zuo came to fight again, and Zong Bao offered Guiying to set up an ambush, and led the troops to fight again, luring Bai Zuo into the mouth of the East Valley. Bai Tianzuo found out that he had been tricked and ordered the Liao soldiers to surround Guiying and fight. Although Guiying had fetal movement and abdominal pain, she still fought hard to kill the enemy, and finally chopped off the horse with a saber during the day, saved Hongzhou from danger, and returned to the court triumphantly.",

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "In 1936, the Long March of the Red Army passed through the Tibetan area along the Jinsha River. The Kuomintang colluded with the local tyrant Qiu Wanli in an attempt to prevent the Red Army from crossing the river northward. Qiu Wanli ordered his minion Qiu Jiu to pretend to be the Red Army, and robbed Zhuma, the only daughter of the chieftain Sangger, and aroused the chieftain's hatred of the Red Army. Adhering to the party's ethnic policy, the Red Army rescued Zhuma from Qiu Wanli's clutches, defeated the blocking enemies, crossed the Jinsha River, and reached the Tibetan fringe areas. Qiu rushed to Hong Kong to enter Tibet, falsely claiming that Zhuma had been killed by the Red Army, and provided weapons and ammunition to instigate the chieftain to attack the Red Army. At this time, Red Army instructor Jin Ming was ordered to lead a squad to escort Zhuma back to the village. Qiu Jiu found Zhuma and wanted to shoot Zhuma to death. Jin Ming saw through the enemy's trick, and sent another soldier Tang Xiaomiao up the mountain to deliver a letter to the chieftain. Fearing that the conspiracy would be exposed, Qiu Wanli killed Qiu Jiu and assassinated Tang Xiaomiao. In order to thoroughly expose the enemy's conspiracy, the Red Army decided to send Jin Ming to venture up the mountain to negotiate with the chieftain. Zhuma had gradually learned about the Red Army, so she handed over the orb she was wearing to her father, Chieftain Sanger, whom Jin Ming brought to her. When the chieftain saw Zhuzi, he was dubious and sent his confidant Jieren Yeba down the mountain. On the way, Jieren Yeba was plotted against by Qiu Wanli. He was wounded and climbed to the Red Army's garrison and told the Red Army about the situation. Seeing that Jieren Yeba had not returned, the chieftain, under the instigation of Qiu Wanli, wanted to kill the detained Red Army hostage Jin Ming. At the critical moment, Zhuma led the Red Army to arrive and exposed the enemy's conspiracy to the chieftain. Qiu Wanli fled fearing the crime, fell into the Jinsha River in a panic and died. The Red Army continued northward.",

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "In 1943, Yang Xiaodong, the political commissar of the guerrillas, entered an ancient city in northeast China with makeup. With the cooperation of the underground traffic officers Jinhuan and Yinhuan sisters, they planned to win over the false regiment leader Guan Jingtao first, and then attack the city. During an ambush, the guerrillas captured Guan Jingtao and released him later. Guan Jingtao was released back, which aroused the suspicion of Japanese adviser Tada and puppet commander Gao Dacheng, and made Jin Huan, who was betrayed and arrested by the traitor Gao Ziping, confront Guan Jingtao. Jin Huan tactfully relieved Guan Jingtao of his responsibility and died heroically. Later, Yang's mother was also betrayed by Gao Ziping. Yinhuan endured the grief of her sister's sacrifice, and was eager to rescue Yang's mother. She accidentally exposed the location of her meeting with Yang Xiaodong in front of Gao Ziping. Gao Dacheng wanted to use the love between mother and child to soften Yang Xiaodong, so as to wipe out my underground party organization. In order to let her son resolutely fight, Yang's mother fell to her death. With the cooperation of the martial arts team and the underground party organization, Yinhuan took the risk to rescue Yang Xiaodong, but Yang Xiaodong resolutely hid himself in order to complete the task of winning Guan Jingtao. Once, Guan Jingtao's subordinates came to search. In a critical moment, Guan saved Yang from danger. Seeing that the time is ripe, Yang Xiaodong and Yinhuan visit Guan in person, affirming the righteousness and moving Guan deeply. In the end, Yang Xiaodong took the opportunity of Gao Dacheng to order the puppet army to go out of the city to grab food, and with the cooperation of the martial arts team, he eliminated the spy captain Lan Mao who came to supervise, and led the uprising Guan Jingtao to the mountain. In the life-and-death struggle, Yang Xiaodong fell in love with Yinhuan. When Yang Xiaodong finished his task and bid farewell to Yinhuan, he gave Yinhuan a red heart ring that his mother had left for his future daughter-in-law.",

When he was a teenager, he was taken as a domestic slave by Wang Jie and served as a {QUOTE}horse{QUOTE} for his young master Lang Jie. He lived an inhuman life. The stubborn little Qiangba never spoke again and expressed his resistance with silence. One day after the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, the grown-up Qiangba followed Lang Jie to meet the People's Liberation Army. When Lang Jie asked him to carry him across the river, he deliberately threw Lang Jie off his back. Fortunately, when the People's Liberation Army came, Qiangba avoided the master's punishment. The People's Liberation Army healed Qiangba's injuries and sent him back on horseback. Fearing that the serfs would wake up, Lang Jie asked the housekeeper to tie Qiangba behind a horse and drag him to death. He was rescued by Gesang, the elder brother of the female slave Lando, the blacksmith. Qiangba and Lan Duo went to find the People's Liberation Army together.

He decided to ask the young Communist Party member Hu Sufang to help Chen Jingyi's wife, the warehouse keeper Lan Caihua, check the accounts. Chen Jingyi took advantage of the opportunity of He Wenjin to go out, and set up a trap to frame Hu Sufang in order to fish in troubled waters. Hu Sufang strayed into the warehouse and fell into the enemy's trap. The team leader Chen Guangqing recognized the enemy as a friend, and believed that Hu Sufang had stolen rice seeds. He Wenjin came back from going out, and after knowing the whole situation, he enlightened and induced Chen Youcai, who was used by the bad guys, and Chen realized something. That night, Chen Youcai was on his way to report to He Zhishu when he was stopped by Chen Guangxi and told him to sink the boat of rice seeds hidden in Heiyuzui. Chen Youcai didn't listen to Chen Guangxi's command, but instead drove the rice planting boat back to the village. Chen Jingyi and Chen Guangxi chased after them. When they were about to attack Chen Youcai, He Zhishu led the militia to arrive in time, rescued Chen Youcai, and arrested Chen Jingyi and Chen Guangxi. The leadership of Xiaochenzhuang has finally returned to the hands of the people.",

Li Minggang and Xiao Huang, our public security officers, based on the clues that an old woman's travel bag was exchanged on the train, found out that Lin Yonggui, the nephew of Lin Dexiang, an old worker in the power plant, was the spy who exchanged the old woman's handbag, and captured Lin Yonggui. Then, Li Minggang pretended to be Lin's spy target, and prepared to meet with the people sent by the US-Jiangsu secret service. Because he was not calm enough to show his flaws, Xu Ying, a female spy who came to monitor secretly, noticed and reported to Qian Jiaren. Fearing that the matter would be revealed, Qian decided to abandon Lin Yonggui and change the target of the blasting. In order to confuse the public security personnel, Qian Jiaren deliberately left a bomb at the location where the bomb was hidden, and hid the other bomb in the universal meter. The universal meter is brought into the substation. With the help of Teacher He, Li Minggang discovered the situation and rushed to the substation in time to remove the bomb.

Zipei strayed into the Liuchun Courtyard by mistake, and the imperial concubine Zhang Shuzhao saw him with both talents and looks, so she fell in love with him. At this time, the emperor arrived, and Zipei had no time to escape, which aroused the emperor's suspicion. Concubine Zhang and Zipei are called sisters and brothers, but the emperor still doesn't believe it, so he summons Maolong again. Concubine Zhang was quick to gain wit and cleverly deceived the emperor. Afterwards, Concubine Zhang took advantage of the opportunity of the emperor going to Datong to meet Liu Qianqian, a famous courtesan, and sent someone to invite Zipei to the palace to meet her. At this time, the emperor returned from his visit to the United States, and Zipei hurriedly hid behind the rockery in the back garden. During the banquet, the emperor suddenly left the banquet and walked towards the rockery. Concubine Zhang cleverly blocked the emperor's sight, so that Zipei could be diverted. Unexpectedly, the emperor saw him again, so Zipei had to pretend to be a servant to pour wine for the emperor. The emperor summoned Maolong again. Seeing his son here, Mao Long turned pale with fright. But with the help of Concubine Zhang, the danger was saved once again. Afterwards, fearing that his son would cause trouble, Mao Long ordered him to return home. Before leaving, Zipei disguised herself as a woman, ventured into the palace, and confided with Xuemei about her escape, which was heard by Concubine Zhang. At this time, the emperor arrived and Xuan Xuemei entered the palace. Concubine Zhang motioned Xue Mei to pretend to be sick and fell to the ground, and Zipei hurried forward to help her. Seeing that Zipei was quite attractive, the emperor wanted to accept her as his concubine. Zipei made up a lie saying that his fate was not good and evaded it. The emperor summoned Maolong again and ordered him to write an imperial edict to kill all fortune-tellers. Zipei and Xuemei reprimanded the emperor, and the emperor ordered them to be poisoned to death with poisoned wine. Concubine Zhang secretly changed the poisoned wine, rescued Zi Pei and Xue Mei, and let them out of the palace.",

Later, when Xiangjun learned from Yang Longyou that the silver was a gift from Ruan, he resolutely asked Yang to return the things to Ruan Dacheng.

In order to fight for the uprising of the 369th Division, which is not directly related to Jiang's army, our Northeast Democratic Alliance Army released Zheng Hanchen and his wife, the cronies of Zhao Chongwu, the commander of the enemy's 369th Division, who were captured, and searched for the lost children on behalf of Zheng, which moved Zheng deeply. After Zheng returned to the city, he was suspected by the secret agents. Zhao Chongwu's troops were squeezed out and monitored by the 203rd Division of Jiang Jun's direct line. Mrs. Zheng was insulted by a company commander of the 203rd Division, which further deepened the internal contradictions of the enemy. The Democratic Alliance Army sent Minister Jiang to persuade Zhao Chongwu to abandon the dark side and turn to the Ming under the pretext of giving Zheng a child, but Zhao was still unable to make up his mind to revolt. Soon, the connection between Minister Jiang and Zheng was discovered by Qian Xiaozheng, the chief of staff of the 203rd Division, who was placed by Jiang Jun's confidant, and Qian tried to arrest Jiang and Zheng. At this time, Zhao Chongwu, who had just been promoted to an official rank, ordered Zheng to send Jiang away for fear of being involved. After that, Hu Gaocan, a senior Kuomintang staff officer who came to inspect, ordered Zhao Chongwu's division to take on the main task of breaking through. The enemy's first breakout was severely hit by our army. Zhao was injured and severely reprimanded by Hu Gaocan. Then Zhao discovered that Chiang Kai-shek instructed Hu Gaocan to eradicate his secret message after breaking through. Zhao was besieged and disillusioned. Decided to lead an uprising.

When I got home and asked, I found out that it was the old party secretary who saw that Shufang had forgotten her selfishness all day long, and took the initiative to hoe the private land for her. Facts have educated Aunt Li and corrected her erroneous views on her daughter-in-law.",

Nie Yujiao, the landlady in the village, secretly collected information on our coastal defense and provided it to Chen Guanyun, the third brother who fled to Hong Kong as a spy, and encouraged his niece Chen Meijuan to lure Tian Shixiong, a high school graduate who was worried about accounting work, to flee to Hong Kong. Tian Xiuying, secretary of the party branch of the brigade and captain of the militia, criticized and helped his younger brother Tian Shixiong many times. Instead of listening to his sister's advice, Tian Shixiong left home to find a job in Guangzhou. Seeing that the plot to win Tian Shixiong failed, Nie Yujiao sent Chen Meijuan to Hong Kong with information, and Chen was arrested on the way. After Tian Shixiong returned to the village and learned that Chen Meijuan had been arrested, he came to his senses. Soon, the United States and Chiang Kai-shek sent Qiu Zhengguang, commander of the first column of the Kuomintang advance army, to lead enemy agents to land in disguise as our People's Liberation Army. Nie Yujiao was arrested by the militia when he was about to cooperate with the enemy agents. Xiuying led the militia to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to wipe out the enemy agents. A few days later, Chen Guanyun led the second batch of enemy agents to land and was also wiped out. Jin Niu, the production team leader, used to be paralyzed in thinking and only focused on production, ignoring coastal defense work. Through the enemy's landing incident, he also realized his mistake.",

Lin's wife argued with him, but was persecuted instead, the young crops were destroyed, the land deeds were torn up, and the baby was thrown to death. Lin Youshan believed that the Kuomintang county government office could avenge the people's grievances, so he went to file a lawsuit, but instead he was thrown into an unjust prison. Lin's wife couldn't bear it anymore, and sued the bogus Zhejiang Provincial Court. The Wu judge who tried the case played tricks, released Lin Youshan on the surface, and falsely summoned Wu Tianbao, using Lin Youshan as a ladder for him to get promoted and get rich. When Lin Youshan returned to his hometown, he saw that the house had been burned down, his wife had been brutally murdered, and his son Zhigang had been forced to flee. Filled with grievances, he took his daughter Juying with him and traveled thousands of miles to Nanjing to file a complaint with the pseudo-Supreme Court, but was expelled. When he went out, he stopped the car to call for grievances, and was insulted again. Wu Zhancheng wanted to buy Lin's father and daughter with money, but was rejected and reprimanded by Lin Youshan. Afterwards, Lin Youshan carried the yellow list on his back, appealed his grievances to passers-by in the streets and alleys of Nanjing, and exposed the crimes of landlords and corrupt officials. The reactionary authorities panicked and killed Lin's daughter, Juying, and imprisoned Lin Youshan in a lunatic asylum. Ten years later, Lin returned to his hometown from the lunatic asylum, carved a stele to remind future generations to remember this class enmity, and then committed suicide by touching the stele. In 1949, Lin Youshan's hometown was liberated. His son Zhigang joined the People's Liberation Army and returned to his hometown with the army. The landlord Wu Tianbao was tried publicly, and Lin Youshan's hatred was finally cleared.",

After liberation, A Bing became the captain of the militia and took the lead everywhere in the land reform and the struggle against the enemy agents. One day in 1952, the snake-headed man sneaked back to Lianhua Township with a trusted enemy agent, trying to flee to Taiwan with his wife and children. When the enemy agent was stealing a boat by the sea, he was discovered by the fisherman A Liang and his daughter. The enemy agent wanted to attack with a knife, but was rescued by A Bing who was on patrol. Snake-headed boils were hidden in his wife Shuzhen's house.{LINE_CUT} Not long after the militia found out, the smuggler told Shuzhen to report a false case to confuse the militia, and then took the opportunity to escape. Ten years later, Snakehead Bo led a small group of enemy agents to invade the mainland. A Bing's wife, A Liang, led his son, Niu Zai, to a small island to cut laver, and met the enemy. The snake head asked A Liang to return to the village to deliver a letter to Shuzhen, and took A Liang's son as a hostage. At the risk of sacrificing his own son, A Liang led the militia to do whatever he could and landed on the island. With the cooperation of the public security forces, he wiped out all the enemy agents who landed and rescued his son.",

The squad leader, Niu Fushan, worked in a simple and rude way. He was very disgusted with Xiaolong's way of posting big-character posters, and immediately tore them down. One Sunday, Xiaolong went to the field to play the flute by himself. Niu Fushan asked him to practice assassination. Once, company commander Lin Zhiyong accidentally found a dry food bag under Xiaolong's pillow. This was exactly what he gave to Xiaolong's family after he was seriously injured more than ten years ago when he liberated Guangzhou, but Lin did not tell Xiaolong to send the dry food bag. It is him who is the only one who cares, but uses the history of blood and tears of the oppressed class before liberation to inspire and educate Xiaolong. At this time, Xiaolong's sister Xiaozhu came to perform with the art troupe. At Lin's suggestion, she sang the story about this rice bag. Xiaolong was deeply moved.

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "Dinuo, a girl from the Jingpo ethnic group who was the slave of the early Kunshan officials in Dulongzhai, Dehong, Yunnan, fled down the mountain to find the People's Liberation Army because she could not bear the persecution by the officials. Later, the working group of the People's Liberation Army came to Dulongzhai to help the Jingpo people carry out democratic reforms. In order to destroy the relationship between the Jingwan people and the People's Liberation Army, Zao Kun spread a rumor that Di Nuo was snatched by the People's Liberation Army. Dino's lover Ledin believed it, and was hostile to the working group. Dr. Li of the working group enthusiastically treated the diseases of the Jingpo people, and suggested opening fields to plant rice and changing the local slash-and-burn farming method. Soon, Dinuo returned to the village and was tied up by the Kunshan officials to be beaten to death. Fortunately, Dr. Li learned that he brought someone to rescue him. After Dinuo returned to the village, he organized the masses to set up a mutual aid group. Zao Kun uses superstition to prevent Kai Tian and destroy the mutual aid group. Dino led the masses to fight against it. Seeing that the plot failed, Zao Kun went on to rob marriages again, instigating people to snatch Di Nuo to Nonggang Village, and then instigated Dulong Village and Nonggang Village to fight enemies. Dr. Li exposed Zao Kun's conspiracy, and the Zao Zha Shan official in Nonggang Village released Dai Nuo, so that the disputes between the two villages were settled satisfactorily. Not long after Dinuo returned to the village, the village people's government was established in Dulongzhai, and Dinuo was elected as the village head.",

After completing the task of fixing fertilizers, she took the lead in selling the agricultural fertilizers used by the family to irrigate the private land to the collective. Her husband, Zhao Risheng, only thinks about his own small plans. Gendi used the advanced deeds of other members to inspire and educate her husband, helping her husband establish a collectivist ideology.{LINE_CUT} {QUOTE}Two Ridges{QUOTE} (Lv Opera){LINE_CUT} Young farmer Qin Junhai was eager to go to the movies with his partner, so he hoeed the ground hastily. Jun Hai's father, Mr. Qin, is the production team leader. He is selfless and asks his son to return to work. The old wife loved her son dearly and interceded for him. After Junhai left, Xiumei, a girl from the village, came to find Junhai. The old wife guessed that Xiumei might be his son's lover, and she was very happy. Laozheng criticizes Xiumei indiscriminately, saying that the Youth League branch has neglected the education work for young people, and blames Xiumei for his son's sloppy work, which really annoys the old Zheng wife who is at the side. After hearing this, Xiumei persuaded Lao Zheng with reason, so that he understood that the work of educating young people should not be simple and rude, and be eager for success. After Junhai came back, Xiumei patiently enlightened and educated Junhai, helping him recognize his mistakes. When Jun Hai and his father carried the hoe to the field to rework the hoe, they found that the ground had already been hoeed. It turned out that Xiumei had taken the initiative to re-hoe the two ridges for Jun Hai. Jun Hai and his father were very moved. The old Zheng wife was getting late, so she took out the prepared dry food and distributed it to Jun Hai and Xiumei, telling them to go to the movies quickly. Only then did Lao Zheng suddenly realize. The old couple smiled knowingly as they watched their sons and their daughter-in-law, who had never married, happily go to the movies together.",

When the opera troupe was singing in Shaoxing, the local gentry Ni San failed to molest Yuehong, so he colluded with the head of the pseudo-police to arrest Yuehong under the pretext of {QUOTE}women sing operas and corrupt morals{QUOTE}. Demonstrating to the public at the bridgehead, the theater troupe was also banned from performing. Later, Yuehong's father, Master Xing, was persecuted to death by the police. Taking advantage of the danger, the troupe leader, Axin, disbanded the troupe. Chunhua and Yuehong sold themselves to bury their father, and were brought to Shanghai by Axin. Manager Tang of a theater in Shanghai regards Chunhua and Yuehong as cash cows, and quickly makes a fortune. He tries to lure Chunhua and Yuehong into performing reactionary plays in order to anesthetize the people's will to resist Japan, but Chunhua refuses. Yuehong fell into Manager Tang's trap while intoxicated with feasting and feasting, so that she fell into a depravity and committed herself to Manager Tang.

Under the suggestion of Committee Member Pan of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee, Manager Tang instructs Axin to blind Chunhua's eyes with lime in order to destroy their performance. After the incident, the reactionary authorities were afraid that the conspiracy would be revealed, so in order to restore the influence, they decided to hold a trial. Manager Tang coerced Yuehong to appear in court for trial and asked her to confess that she was the mastermind, plotting to turn political persecution into sisterly grievances. Chunhua publicly exposed the reactionary conspiracy in court, and Yuehong was so conflicted that she passed out in court.

Now Changqing's son, Guo Hong, and Che Fu's daughter, Che Feng, are engaged, and they have become in-laws again. On the eve of Guo Changqing's return to Hongshi, through someone's introduction, Che Fu adopted Jia Yuhua from another village as his wife. As soon as Jia Yuhua came to Che's house, she secretly used the team's public funds to buy sheep for her family when Fu was not at home.{LINE_CUT}After Guo Changqing came to Hongshi, he decided to build a pumping station to divert the water from Dalong Bay up the mountain to solve the problem of nine droughts in ten years. For this, the cadres and the masses of Hongshi were very happy, but Che Fu was very dissatisfied with this plan. He said that Guo Changqing deliberately wanted to bring down Hongshi.

He decided to rely on himself and went to Futun to raise funds. After Guo Changqing left, Jia Yuhua, in the name of Che Fu, took seven or eight laborers from the Yangshui Station construction site to build a sheepfold for her house. As a result, Che Feng had a falling out with her father and stepmother and was kicked out of the house. At this time, people on the construction site were also affected by Che Fu, and they left the construction site one after another. Some went to open up wasteland, some went to the mountains to dig medicinal materials, and some went to the market... Seeing this situation, Che Feng simply stayed at the construction site. . At this moment, Guo Changqing came back. It turned out that he went to Futun to sell his new house, bought a diesel engine for the pumping station, and brought his son Guo Hong from the factory to Hongshi to participate in the production and construction. When Che Fu learned of these truths, he was deeply moved by Guo Changqing's behavior. Guo Changqing further offered him sincere help and told him that Jia Yuhua was a rich peasant who concealed his identity after the commune's investigation and the team member Zhang Fu's confirmation. molecular. All this made Che Fu sober. He severed ties with Jia Yuhua and asked her to wait for processing. He and Guo Changqing devoted themselves to the construction of the pumping station.",

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "In 1925, young intellectuals Jin Gongshou, Gu Daming, and Yang Rukuan fled their hometown to seek a way out because they were dissatisfied with the dark reality. On the way, they rescued Yu Hongkui who escaped from marriage. The four became brothers and came to Jinan to enter Shandong No. 1 Normal School. Jin Gongshou met Mr. Zhao Jinzhang, a member of the Communist Party, and Yu Hongkui met Mr. Xue Jianbai, a member of the Kuomintang. Under the inspiration and education of the teacher, the four of them often secretly read progressive books together, talked about revolutionary principles, and began to get in touch with revolutionary activities. During this period, they also got to know two female classmates, Xie Hui and Liu Fen. With the arrival of the revolutionary climax, Zhao Jinzhang moved to the south with his lover Song Zhuping, a member of the Communist Party, and joined the Northern Expedition. In a demonstration in support of the Northern Expedition, the students fought against the reactionary military and police. Jin Gongshou was very brave, while Yu Hongkui was very cowardly. After the Northern Expedition captured Wuhan, six young students rushed to Wuchang with passion. Under the impact of the Great Revolution, they each embarked on different paths due to their different backgrounds, experiences and aspirations. Yu Hongkui took refuge in Xue Jianbai, who was a councilor in the 35th Army of the Kuomintang; Yang Rukuan joined the Northern Expedition Propaganda Team for personal hobbies; Jin Gongshou, Gu Daming, Xie Hui and Liu Fen applied for the Central Military Political School. Soon, Jin and Gu were assigned to the Changsha Military Branch School in Hunan, where they reunited with Zhao Jinzhang, who was an instructor at the branch school. After the {QUOTE}April 12{QUOTE} counter-revolutionary coup in 1927, Xue Jianbai, who pretended to be a revolutionary, took Yu Hongkui to sneak to Changsha to instigate rebellion. Yu wanted to use Gu's honesty and honesty to find out the situation of the Communist Party in the branch school, but was reprimanded by the other party. Based on the reports of Gu and Jin, Zhao Jinzhang had a premonition that the counter-revolutionaries would take action, and repeatedly put forward positive suggestions to the leaders, but they were all rejected by the right opportunists. Soon, the counter-revolutionary Ma-ri incident really happened in Changsha. Subsequently, the reactionaries also created troubles in the branch school in an attempt to cleanse the revolutionary forces in the school. Xue Jianbai's plot to trap Zhao Jinzhang failed, and ordered Yu Hongkui to kill Zhao Jinzhang. Jin Gongshou and Gu Daming, who have joined the Communist Party, rescued Zhao Jinzhang regardless of their own lives. According to Zhao's dying instructions, they returned to Wuchang and found the party organization through Song Zhuping. Together with Xie Hui and Liu Fen, they withstood severe tests under the leadership of the party. After Yang Rukuan failed in the Northern Expedition, he became a deserter in pessimism and disappointment. On the eve of the {QUOTE}July 15th{QUOTE} counter-revolutionary rebellion in Wuhan, the revolutionary forces gathered in Wuhan moved to the countryside under the leadership of the Communist Party and eliminated the reactionary armed forces that came to intercept them. Jin Gongshou and Gu Daming shot the traitor Yu Hongkui, followed the revolutionary team, participated in the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Comrade Mao Zedong, took the road of combining workers and peasants, and continued to grow in the storm of revolution.",

As she grows older, Mrs. Hua, who is nearly middle-aged, begins to get tired of the life of a thief, and wants to live a peaceful life with her daughter from now on. Mrs. Hua was a righteous person, and wanted to have an explanation to her brothers before disbanding, so she took out all her savings and distributed them to them. However, instead of being ungrateful, the treacherous old Liu spread the word that she wanted to abandon her brothers and enjoy the happiness with her daughter. Mrs. Hua was enraged and shot and wounded Lao Liu. Lao Liu therefore held a grudge against her. Mrs. Hua came to the countryside full of joy, but her brother-in-law told her that Xiaofeng had died of a sudden illness. Mrs. Hua was very sad. Now that her daughter is gone, her future life doesn't matter. The disheartened Mrs. Hua decides to continue her career as a thief. In fact, Xiaofeng did not die, but was sold into a brothel by her black-hearted uncle. This secret was known by Lao Liu who secretly followed Mrs. Hua, and he quietly {QUOTE}stealed{QUOTE} Xiaofeng out of the brothel. Six years have passed in a blink of an eye, and under the meticulous training of Lao Liu, Xiaofeng has become a habitual thief under the alias of Miss Bai. However, Mrs. Hua has been kept in the dark. One day, the noble lady Mrs. Li held a grand banquet. Miss Bai, Mrs. Hua, and a young man named Xu Zhixiang who was forced to be a thief all got in. Their goal is the same: Mrs. Li's cat's eye jewel. At the beginning, Maoyan was actually stolen by Xu Zhixiang, who was not very clever; but after a while, he was deceived by Miss Bai. Just when the two were depressed and the other proud, Madam Hua appeared in front of them and ridiculed them as stupid thieves with blind eyes. It turned out that the cat's eye in Miss Bai's hand was a fake, and the real one had fallen into Mrs. Hua's hands. The haughty Miss Bai couldn't bear such humiliation, so she brought a few accomplices to find Mrs. Hua desperately. After a lot of tossing, Miss Bai didn't hurt Mrs. Hua, but she almost had an accident. Instead, she was rescued by Mrs. Hua, and fell in love with Xu Zhixiang because of this. Xu Zhixiang was originally an upright young man. He was unwilling to be degraded and decided to reform himself. Under his influence, Miss Bai also decided to quit. Mrs. Hua was very annoyed by this, and decided to implement family law against Xu Zhixiang. However, when Mrs. Hua learned from Lao Liu that Miss Bai was her daughter Xiaofeng, she couldn't help being pleasantly surprised, and immediately canceled the decision to execute Xu Zhixiang. Lao Liu was so angry that he threatened Xiaofeng's life and forced Mrs. Hua to enforce the family law against Xu Zhixiang. For the sake of her daughter, Mrs. Hua had no choice but to do so, but she only injured Xu Zhixiang's shoulder. Miss Bai, who didn't know anything about it, would naturally not be grateful to Mrs. Hua, but she was full of hatred for her because she hurt her lover. Soon after recovering from his injury, Xu Zhixiang will marry Miss Bai. Mrs. Hua knew that Lao Liu would never let them go, so she hurried to the church and shot Lao Liu who was about to commit murder outside the church door. In the church, Miss Bai and Xu Zhixiang were married in the wedding march. Seeing that her daughter was happy, Mrs. Hua followed the police into the police car without complaint.",

Chief engineer Wu Zongbao, encouraged by military representatives He Zheng and Wang Dafu, and at the same time recognized the great spirit of the Communist Party of serving the people, returned to work in the factory and was ordered to draft a repair plan. Liu Zhong, the director of the Third Power Plant, is the minion of the US imperialist spy Father Kim. He has been using the opportunity to destroy the power plant's machines, throwing the whole city into darkness and stopping production. After Wu Zongbao's proposal was completed, they stole it and burned it while it was being submitted for approval. The plan was stolen, and Wu Zongbao's work mood suddenly became negative. Father Jin took the opportunity to use Mrs. Wu's admiration for American life to lure them to work in Japan. Wu Zongbao is a conscientious technical expert, and he categorically rejected Father Jin's coaxing. At the same time, because the superior understood the seriousness of the situation, he approved He Zheng's request, and started repairing immediately without waiting for the plan to be rewritten. In this way, Bandit's plot finally failed. The mission was completed shortly and electricity has been regularly distributed throughout the city. On the day when the electricity was generated, Father Jin tried to blow up the whole plant in his last resort. Fortunately, due to the report of the workers and the investigation of the public security personnel, the bandits were wiped out when they attacked, and Father Jin and Liu Zhong were arrested. The repaired generator finally sent electricity, and the whole city was shrouded in splendor.",

Xu Ce sympathized with what happened to the Xue family, and felt very emotional in his heart. Before execution, Xu Ce replaced Xue Meng's son Xue Jiao with his own son and raised him up. One day, Xu Ce asked Xue Jiao to write a letter to Hanshan, and asked his third uncle Xue Gang and third aunt Ji Luanying to send troops to avenge the Xue family. When Xu Ce learned that Xue Gang had led the troops to Chang'an, he went to the city to watch and open the city gate to welcome them regardless of his old age and frailty. Xue Jiabing wanted to kill people in the Forbidden City to avenge blood hatred. Xu Ce considered the stability of the country, so he agreed in person to play the book for Xue Gang and Xue Jiao in person, asking the emperor to kill the traitor Zhang Tai and avenge the Xue family. traitor. Therefore, Xue Gang ordered the troops to retreat 40 miles, waiting for news from Xu Ce. Seeing the majesty of the descendants of the Xue family and the strong soldiers and horses of the Xue family, Xu Ce felt that the country had hope and was very happy.

One day, Song Jiang met Liu Tang and hurriedly dragged him to a secluded restaurant for a chat. He hastily accepted an ingot of silver, and hurriedly put the letter and the ingot of silver into the paper bag; and urged Liu Tang to take the rest of the silver and return to Liangshan quickly. After Song Jiang sent Liu Tang away, he met Yan Po who was looking for him. Yan Po was once honored by Song Jiang's gift of gold to bury her husband, so she promised her daughter Yan Xijiao to Song Jiang as a concubine and lived in Wulongyuan, but Yan Xijiao secretly associated with Song Jiang's student Zhang Wenyuan. So Song Jiang vowed not to see Yan Xijiao again. Yan Po came to look for him, and Song Jiang had no choice but to go to Wulongyuan. The next day, Song Jiang hurried out and accidentally dropped the paper bag on the ground. After Yan Xijiao woke up, she picked up the paper bag and found the letters between Song Jiang and Liang Shan. When Song Jiang came back to look for the paper bag, Yan Xijiao took the opportunity to blackmail Song Jiang, telling him to write a letter of divorce immediately, allowing herself to remarry Zhang Wenyuan. In order to return the Liangshan letter, Song Jiang had to agree to her request. Unexpectedly, after Yan Xijiao received the letter, she threatened to hand over Liangshan's letter only in the lobby of Yuncheng County, intending to put Song Jiang to death.

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "In northern Jiangsu, the ten famine production brigade guards thousands of acres of saline-alkali land, suffers from famine every year, and relies on relief every year. The members wholeheartedly hoped to change the backwardness of the brigade as soon as possible, but Qian Xingui, who came from a wealthy middle peasant, spread the word among the masses, saying: \"If you can pull out the roots of poverty, unless the chicken feathers fly to the sky!\" Upon returning from a county meeting, he immediately refuted Qian Xingui's words, \"Chairman Mao said that chicken feathers must fly to the sky!\" Cai Gang followed the county party committee's spirit of changing the backwardness of the poor team, and actively led the backbone of the brigade to study the plan to turn around. In the past, due to lack of water, the Ten Desolation Brigade had been planting dry valleys, but the yield was low. In order to increase production and income, it is necessary to divert water and open canals to replant rice. The team leader Zhang Youwang was conservative and worried that it would be difficult to open the canal. If it failed, the commune members' rations for this year would be lost. Just when the members of the commune were working in full swing to divert water and open canals, they encountered dead soil on the construction site. In order to make a fortune for himself, Qian Xingui focused on his sideline business. Seeing that the project encountered difficulties, he took the opportunity to spread rumors secretly, which made the members panic. At this time, Secretary Wang of the commune party committee came to the Shihuang Brigade and encouraged everyone to set up ambitions, set up big ambitions, overcome difficulties, and complete the task of opening canals. At the same time, he also reminded Cai Gang not to only see the superficial difficulties on the construction site, but to pay attention to the capitalist spontaneous forces formed by backward elements. Afterwards, Cai Gang organized the production team to hold a debate meeting. At the debate, members of the commune exposed and criticized Qian Xingui's small-scale peasant consciousness and the idea of taking the capitalist road, so that all members of the commune were educated and realized that in order to change the poverty and backwardness of the Ten Desolation Brigade, it is necessary to follow the social path. road to collectivism. At this time. Team leader Zhang Youwang also realized his mistake of conservatism. The leaders of the Ten Desolation Brigade and the masses unified their thinking and understanding, and with full enthusiasm and vigor, devoted themselves to labor in full swing. Finally, they overcame various difficulties and finally opened the aqueduct. This year, the Ten Desolation Brigade won a bumper rice harvest. The threshing floor presents a festive scene, the crowds come and go like a shuttle, and the sounds of labor, machines, singing and laughter merge into an inspiring movement. Cai Gang told Secretary Wang who came to the threshing ground that this year \"in addition to seed grain, rations, and feed, we can also sell surplus grain.\" Secretary Wang said to everyone: The chicken feathers are flying to the sky, but this is just the beginning... He asked the commune members to seize the opportunity and start autumn plowing immediately. Soon, the Shihuang Brigade was renamed \"Yuejin Brigade\" with the approval of the commune.",

Brother Liu, Meng Nan and Li Xinqun rescued Jinmei to the home of her friend Liang Ruoying. Ruoying was impatient with poverty and loneliness because her husband Zhang Yuliang went to the mainland to participate in the Anti-Japanese War, so she married the banker Wang Zhongyuan, but she was also disturbed by Wang's pro-Japan attitude. One day, Ruoying receives a letter from Yuliang, saying that she has come to Shanghai and wants to see her beloved daughter Beibei, so they meet at Mengnan and Xinqun's house. Ruoying goes there as promised, and during the conversation with Yuliang, Japanese spies arrive, mistaking them for Mengnan and Xinqun and arresting them. Meng Nan quickly left Shanghai. After Jinmei was humiliated, she was fired by the factory, and her husband Yousheng was also beaten by hooligans and lost his sight. Jinmei was forced to work as a prostitute in order to maintain her life and treat her husband. Yuliang and Ruoying were released because they had no criminal evidence. Yuliang continued to engage in underground anti-Japanese activities. Ruoying was greedy for material comforts and still lived with Wang Zhongyuan. Under the instigation of the Japanese army, Wang established the \"East Asia Publishing House\", and Brother Liu, Yuliang, and Xinqun fought against it. Ruoying finds out that Wang is having another affair, and then discovers Wang's traitorous behavior, and she can't help feeling regretful. At this time, Yuliang has left Shanghai with Beibei in order to avoid the enemy's pursuit. Feeling ashamed to see others, Ruoying left a letter to Xinqun and came to the river, where she accidentally found Jin Mei. It turned out that Jin Mei was rescued by throwing herself into the river because of unbearable humiliation and her husband's misunderstanding. Ruoying gave up her thoughts of death, and with the help of Xinqun, she embarked on a new journey with Jinmei.",

    "translatedPlotSummary" : "Han Ping, a native of the Song Dynasty, bid farewell to his bride's true husband and went to Beijing to seek an official position. He did not return for six years. His true husband embroidered fish books and asked someone to send them to Han Ping. When Han saw the fish books, he fell in love and fell into a dream. When the court bell rang, Han Huaiyu's book hurried into the palace, but accidentally the fish book fell to the ground, and was seen by the lustful and innocent King Song, who was falsely accused of being a spy and thrown into the dungeon. The King of Song brought his true husband to the palace, saw her beauty, and made her a bride, but the true husband refused, so the King of Song asked his true husband to meet Han Ping at Qingling Terrace, and destroyed Han Rong. In the audience, Han Jie commits suicide by shooting an arrow after reading a blood book, and her true husband also commits suicide by jumping off the platform. The King of Song was furious, and ordered that the graves be buried in two separate places, facing each other far away. In the future, a tree will grow in front of each of the two graves, and they will gradually form a hug. The king of song ordered to cut down the tree, the tree fell, and a pair of mandarin ducks flew out. The king of song shot down a feather and took it for viewing. Mao suddenly lit a fire and burned the king of song to death. Soon the two trees grew again, and later generations called them Acacia trees.",
